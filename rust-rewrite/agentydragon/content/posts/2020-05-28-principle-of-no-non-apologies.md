title: The principle of no non-Apologies
---

**TL;DR:** Principle of no non-Apologies: "Distinguish between saying I'm sorry
and apologizing. Don't give non-Apologies." Do not Apologize when you don't
agree that you fucked up. When you fucked up, own the fuck-up and, if it's
systematic, commit to reducing future fuck-ups.

# Everyday "I'm sorry" is usually not an Apology

"I'm sorry" can be used in several ways.

One way is using it as a conciliatory gesture, basically saying "you're stronger
than me, I submit, please don't hurt me". It's one possible way I might react
when under threat by someone stronger making demands I don't agree with.

Another way is to say "this was accidental, I didn't intend to hurt you", like
when you bump into someone when boarding your tram.

But when you use the words that way, you are not making an _Apology_.  And it's
useful to distinguish between these uses of "I'm sorry" andactual Apologies.

# Apologies and non-Apologies

Courtesy of an unknown source that I can't immediately recall, you are
_Apologizing_ when you:

1. Communicate understanding that you behaved badly (and own responsibility for
   it),
2. try to fix the negative consequences of that behavior, and
3. commit to work on not acting similarly in the future.

An Apology which holds to this definition makes you vulnerable (because you are
open about the weakness that caused the behavior), and it's not to be made
lightly, because of the commitment. It is also virtuous to own your mistakes or
systematic problems, and to work on them.

On the other hand, if you use the ritual apologetic words but do not meet these criteria, let's call that a
_non-Apology_.

A prototypical example is "I'm sorry you feel that way", which happens when a
sociopath in charge is forced by overwhelming force to "Apologize".

"I'm sorry" that you tell your boss just to make them stop grilling you is also,
under my use of the word, a _non-Apology_.

So is, in many (but not all) cases, a "sorry I'm late" I might say when coming
to a meeting. Also the "bump into someone on the tram" example, and the "I yield
I'll do what you demand" example.

(So, notice that I'm not saying non-Apologizes are morally bad. Some of them
are, but many are also just those tiny social rituals you need to do so you
make it clear to people you aren't a dick.)

# Principle of no non-Apologies

My _principle of no non-Apologies_ is two-part:

## Distinguish between saying "I'm sorry" and Apologizing.

This first part I recommend adopting universally. Know the difference between
the social ritual that _evolved from small routinized Apologies_ and actual
Apologies, and know which one you are doing at which time.

## Don't give non-Apologies.

This second part I apply to relationships into which I want to bring my whole
self, mostly my personal relationships, but also some work relationships.

Unfortunately, many of us are stuck in power differential relationships with
people who demand apologetic-sounding words, and there might be no better
solution than to yield. But still, it's good to know that you are saying "I'm
sorry", and not Apologizing. That way, you can appease without cognitive
dissonance.

But in relationships with mutual care and respect and compassion, it should make
sense that you shouldn't be obliged to Apologize if you don't agree that you did
anything wrong.  When you feel pressed to apologize, your first instinct should
be to ask what you did wrong, and if there are different viewpoints, have a
conversation.

If your behavior is worthy of an apology, don't stop at "I'm sorry". Understand
why the behavior happened, and work to prevent it from causing more bad
consequences in the future.

# P.S.: Generalizations

This is just one instance of a more general move of looking at some social
ritual (like apologizing) and looking at it a little "sideways": getting back
in touch with the original meanings of the expressions used in it. Rituals and
words can lose meaning over time, and you can lose concepts when that happens.
If you want to see what it's like to look at things that way, I've had a pretty
vivid experience of it after finishing Wittgenstein's Tractatus.
