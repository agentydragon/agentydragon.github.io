<p>In the last year or so, I’ve been doing some Serious Work at some Serious Businesses (as opposed to single-digit-developer contract projects I did before). A very valuable aspect of working in large and established companies (I in particular went to Google and am now at Dropbox) is having established procedures and experienced mentors.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I didn’t appreciate enough before seeing them in the proper context:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Version control. It’s more than just a list of versions which you can recover later. Proper version control separates the chaos of development into manageably-sized atomic changes: commit hygiene is good. If you don’t know about Git’s <code>-p</code> flag for <code>git add</code> and <code>checkout</code>, you should learn about it and use it. Always have a look at the diff you’re committing before you commit it. Squash commits using <code>rebase -i</code> when it makes more sense. Use branches for separate features, even if you’re a single-person team. Read your own diffs, at least before you merge into master.</p>
<p>A nice commit should be a self-contained change. A history of nice commits is good for with others or with future you. Forcing your changes to be self-contained also requires you to separate your solution into independent logical pieces, which may give you new insights into the problem you are solving.</p></li>
<li><p>Code review. This means that someone looks at your code and reads it. Code reviews are an excellent tool to learn new tricks in your language and codebase from more experienced team members. If you don’t have anyone else to review your code, do it yourself. Actually, just always review your code before asking anyone to review it for you. Seeing a diff of the code you just changed is a bit like reading an essay you wrote backwards: it prevents code blindness.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the right tools and making compromises. You may have learned about object-oriented programming and relational databases and microservices and you want to do The Right Thing on your next project. Guess what? Running this huge <code>SELECT</code> with 2 subqueries on every page access takes like 800 ms and if you want to get around that you’ll have to violate 2NF and cache it in a new column and you’ll have to make your code much more complex and ugly to properly flush it. Maybe you had a lot of fun learning Angular on this project, but did you consider the data has 8 levels of nesting and that the JSON blob is 9 MB large? Go make yourself a coffee before you try scrolling to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Most programming principles are just educated heuristics. Apply proper judgement when using them. Every rule is meant to be broken, and most of them are when used rigidly. Know when it’s better to throw away your tools and just do a hack that works. (By the way, <a href="http://softwareandmind.com/">Software and Mind</a> is a good book on the subject of CS snake oil.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask. Whenever in doubt. Whenever it takes less time to ask than look in the docs. Also, ask when the docs are if you don’t know. Chances are someone else knows, and will be happy to share. Communicate early, communicate often. Ask others for help when debugging weird problems: those are usually typos on line 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Use good tools. Continuously integrate (i.e., know when commits fail tests). Lint everything: check the syntax of your source code <em>and configuration</em>. Pick a well-respected style guide for your language and stick to it. Tell your linter to scream whenever someone tries to bend the rules.</p>
<p>Especially if you use a compiled language, use a good build tool. If you’re using any of the original Google language trinity (C++, Java, Python), consider trying <a href="http://bazel.io/">Bazel</a>. Bazel is the open-source version of the excellent internal build tool called Blaze. It’s fast and it has a very elegant design. The configuration files have a simple syntax and they explicitly describe the dependencies within your project with almost zero boilerplate.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t trust yourself. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/doing-terrible-things-to-your-code/">Do terrible things to your code.</a> Test everything that makes sense - preferably in code. Test on varying levels of abstraction: unit tests for small parts, integration tests for systems. For testing large systems, you may need to spin up several machines and wait an hour or two. It’s still <em>so</em> worth it.</p></li>
<li><p>Fight complexity. Complexity is the mind-killer. Remove dead code (and dead flags, dead protobuf fields, etc.). The number of moving parts in your code exponentially increases the number of states your head must keep track of. This is especially painful if the moving parts are independent. Do not introduce abstraction unless it gives you a win somewhere. Add strict API boundaries between components and force them only to share data through it to avoid hidden dependencies. Sometimes, when faced with a large and complex problem, it’s better to just focus on a small part that’s important to you right now and just bail out when anything else happens.</p></li>
