title: Thesis commitment
---

I want to finish my master's thesis. However, since I will also start working
at Google in February, I'm in danger of not finishing it on time.
I estimate the likelihood that I will finish by the winter deadline (2017-01-04
-- by the way, YYYY-MM-DD is the only correct way to write dates IMO) as roughly
30%, given how busy we are nowadays with organizing EAGxPrague.

Once I come to Google, my short-term incentives will probably set me up for
procrastination and for never finishing my degree.
So, in order to shift my incentives once I'm in Google, I'm making
a commitment. Sorry, me<sub>2017-02</sub>. The sunk costs of your degree are
really high and I think it's a good idea for you to get it.

I promise that if I don't submit my thesis to my university by 2017-07-21
or if I don't have a master's degree by 2018-01-01, I will donate $8000 to
a charity of my thesis advisor's (Petr "pasky" Baudi≈°) choice, above my prior
commitment of 10% of my income (between 2016-10 and 2017-10).
