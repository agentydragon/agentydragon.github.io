title: Against goals
---

First off, it's morning so I want to plan out today.
An unexpected thing that happened yesterday was misstepping on my run down the
stairs when I was going to work, and spraining my ankle. My right ankle, in
which I had arthroscopic surgery some years ago. So I had to go to see (another)
doctor, and probably will be working from home until the swelling stops.
Hopefully it's just a simple sprain and will be alright in a couple of weeks.

Because I had been home and not at work, I didn't have Joylent available - I
just grabbed the ~1/4th a packet I had at home for breakfast, and then when I
came back from having myself drilled in the mouth and touched on the legs, I had
been hungry. And I ended up just very quickly cooking whatever was in the
kitchen, which was a big can of beans from Denner, 5 eggs and a packet of
Chinese noodles. (Since I switched to not cooking and going with Joylent
instead, my kitchen is mostly free of any ingredients of my own...)
I munched all of that down very quickly, and then felt bad, because my stomach
was disturbed and I felt that I had slipped into bad eating habits. I think it
was the beans - they were not very good, predictably. When I started cooking the
stuff, I did not have much agency, and had the opposite of reflection and
mindfulness. I had entered some mode like "gaah eat all the food". It was lucky
for me to not have much actual food at hand, otherwise I might have eaten much
more. I actually think I still was under the 2000 kcal I'm getting daily from
the Joylent.

I don't really know what to do next time. I guess something like a TAP like "omg
want food &rarr; remember to breathe and not eat everything in sight". Doing
mindful eating on the meal would probably also stop it.

Rationality Zurich went fine yesterday. Just 3 people, but we had a nice
conversation about an alternative system of self-development brought up by
my roommate. My summarization of it is:

Goals are pleasant when you meet them, but painful if you don't.
If you tell yourself "today I will run a mile" and then you don't, you get an
"ow". The "ow" makes you feel bad, and so the consequence of missing the goal is
is feeling bad about yourself for a while. If you can stay on a streak of
successfully doing all the things you commit to doing, you will ride a nice
wave of "yay I'm doing all the things and I'm doing well". But miss once, and
now you're a bad bad person (*ow*) and if you're like me, on a deep level, you
just want to curl up and cry.

Also, my goals are sometimes about "forcing myself to do things good for the
long-term, even if they are aversive in the short-term". That can feel like the
part of me which set the goal is grabbing control of everything and dragging
along all parts which might be protesting, which is painful.

An alternative is looking at self-development as a *process*. In that process,
you do not set goals which you *have* to achieve *or it's bad*. You don't try to
create a master plan with 34 steps that will perfectly fix everything if you
follow them perfectly. Instead, you do small things in the now which *are
available to you*, things which *you want to do* (or might enjoy doing but
aren't sure yet) that will bring you a very short distance in the general
direction of *where you want to be*. "Where you want to be" might also best be
thought of as kind of an emotional "this is who I *really* am, this is what is
*really* important to me" - not a S2-type explicit list of
[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals like "I want to
weight <= 90 kg by 2019-01-01".

I really like some things about this view. It's comparatively very non-violent, 
and it natually allows for "okay, so a year ago I thought I wanted to be more
fit, and I started swimming because I like it, and I met this person and talked
with them and changed my goals, so now I want something a bit different", and
you can change what you are "aiming for" (though "aiming for" in a very weak
sense, more like "what kind of thing would feel right") without feeling you're
betraying an earlier commitment.

On the other thing, parts of me seems to *want* some enforcement device - like
the pain you get from missing a goal. Like for some reason I *don't want to
stop feeling bad if I e.g. overeat*.
Maybe a way to make this part feel better about it would be building some
self-trust, or what [the internal family systems
model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) calls
"Self-leadership". Having some Self which makes sure that parts get along
without being violent at each other, and which makes sure that everyone's needs
are met and that parts don't enter prolonged conflicts.
Like, part of me *wants* to make sure I *do* get fit, and it's afraid that if it
lets punishing me for not getting fit, I will not get fit.

So, as for today. I'm staying home to nurse my ankle and having a MRI and a chat
with a friend in the evening. My plan today is to go on one container of
Soylent. I should probably also add another luggage to my flight home.

Part of me feels like this is "a bit too little".
Like "I should also argh be finishing this master's thesis and argh getting
fitter".

Well, actually I'm doing really good so far. I feel good about the new
system/the new process I'm putting into place. Writing about how yesterday went
and thinking about the things I will do today felt *nice*, and *I am now not
in traps in which I used to be* (e.g., the "feel bad &rarr; overeat" trap).

I just realized there's one trap which I haven't mentioned here yet, and maybe
it's one for which I don't yet know how would I avoid it long-term. It's the
trap of the work environment pressuring me into acting not fully authentically
in it.

Say that I am feeling stressed because there's too much noise in my office and
it hurts and I stayed up all night because I was playing Civilization 5.
And what I really want at this point is to go get some sleep.

But it's *work*, and if you *are not at your post without explanation*, your
boss will reproach you for that.

But if you tell your boss "hey, sorry, I stayed up all night playing
Civilization 5 and I feel really bad about it and I just want to sleep please",
that costs you social points. Because you're *socially-supposed to be a strong
independent adult*, and *strong independent adults are not fragile*. And also,
you *don't want to show how fragile you are*, because you have already had your
fragility abused by others plenty of times.

So (barring the opportunity to actually get some sleep), you stay at your post,
and you feel bad about yourself, and you just want everyone in your open space
to shut up, but you can't, because they're allowed to talk at their work place,
so aaaaaaaa :'(

Google's research into effective teams identified this attribute called
"psychological safety", which seems to predict lots of good things, and it seems
to me like the belief that it's *okay* to make mistakes, that you *will not be
personally-judged for what you do*, that *you are not on thin ice*, that *you
are free to be yourself here*.
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be mostly work-related - i.e., "it's *okay* to
break the build for a few days and we won't be mad at you". What I think would
make me feel better at work and more free to be authentic (and also like it
more, because I would *not feel forced into putting up a performance of a solid
worker drone that I actually am not*) would be a kind of "psychological safety"
less about the content of my work and more about "it's okay to be fragile, it's
okay to be disturbed by people talking a lot, it's okay to cry if you're
overwhelmed".

Feeling psychologically unsafe is also kind of self-perpetuating. If you don't
feel safe to e.g. express an overwhelming sadness when you feel you've done
something wrong, and hence you don't do it, you will use it later as more
evidence that you are not psychologically safe here.

Maybe *if* my current work environment is actually supportive of everything like
that and most of my fears/expectations-of-judgement are from this kind of
self-driven feedback loop, some CoZE-type experiments could help. Like, maybe
when I tell my boss I'm feeling bad, don't say it while wearing the mask of
"I'm an efficient worker and emotions are my slaves", and instead let it drop
and shed a few tears or let my voice break. Meh. Probably actually something
weaker than that. This would already feel unsafe.

There's a thought lingering in my head about the "think of it as a process"
thesis. Maybe *things which you have to force yourself into doing* (by way of
e.g., Complice or calendar reminders or willpower or what not) *are not really
worth it*. Because being forced into something hurts. And maybe the thing to do
instead is to start with where I am, and making progress through a sequence of
comfortable expansions at the margins, *all of which feel good and not forced*
and don't make me feel bad if I don't end up doing them.
