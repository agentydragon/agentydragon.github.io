title: October summary, mostly on EA efforts
---

As some of you might know, yours truly along with my friends
[Jirka Nádvorník][jirka] and Radim Lacina founded the [Czech Association for
Effective Altruism][caea] a few months back.
[Dan Hnyk][dan] is not an official member yet, but he's doing a lion's share
of the work. We were also very lucky to bring along Honza, who used to work
on fundraising at the [Forum 2000 foundation](http://www.forum2000.cz/)
and who is helping us with many areas we had little experience with before
he came onboard.
Our goals are to establish an EA community in Czech Republic and to be
the hub of its long-term viability.

Executive summary:

 * Effective altruism in Czech Republic is doing well. We have a medium-term
   plan around movement growth.
 * [EAGxPrague][eagxprague] is happening on December 10 and you are encouraged
   to apply ([Czech application][application-cz], [English
   application][application-en]) and *please* report your experience and
   feedback (the more verbose the better) to [prague@eaglobalx.org](mailto:prague@eaglobalx.org)
 * I encourage you to seek answers to certain questions by using surveys and
   basic statistics. It's fun, easy and powerful.
 * We have very little information on which to estimate how many people will
   apply to the conference. I am curious as to how high will the actual
   number be once we launch distribution.
 * I talk about the importance of good planning.
 * Personally, my depression's back, I am not OK, but who knows, maybe I'll be
   OK one day.

Effective altruism
==

If you haven't heard about [Effective Altruism][ea] yet, it is a philosophy and
social movement, which aims to 1) do good, and 2) do it as efficiently as
possible. You yourself probably try to good in your own life: you probably help
people close to you, and you might sometimes do an altruistic thing for someone
not so close to you: donate a few dollars to this charity or other, give
some clothing you no longer need to someone who does, and so on.

Early EAs have observed one very important and somewhat counterintuitive fact:
*it matters a great lot where do you put your resources*. If you give $3500 to
a charity that trains guide dogs for the blind, it will train roughly one tenth
of a dog ([they cost 32,400 GBP apiece to train][dog-train]). If you give $3500 to
the [Against Malaria Foundation][amf], you *will*, on expectation, ***save
someone's life***, and ***that is a pessimistic estimate*** (it only counts
*infants who would die of malaria infection that will not die thanks to
an installed insecticide-laced mosquito net*, not older children saved from
infection, or prevented suffering from malaria attacks).

So, it matters a great deal that you *put your resources where they have as
much effect as possible*. When you're looking for ways to transport yourself to
work and back, you research options. How much would a car cost? How much would I
pay for gas? What if I bike? Would the extra risk of traffic accidents be worth
it? How about mass transport? Would the extra time be worth the money I save?
Maybe I could work remotely for a day every week?

For some reason, people usually don't think about charity this way.
But it makes perfect sense. If you decide you want to help people with, say,
$1000 of your money, or maybe 7 days of your time, *you should do some research
to ensure you aren't just burning money*. If your work is 3 blocks from where
you live, you wouldn't buy a car to go there. You would probably just walk or
ride a station or two on a bus. Then why are people, for some reason,
*comfortable throwing money into a random charity without knowing what they're
buying for it?*

(The actual reason has to do with the way our brain circuitry gives us warm
fuzzies in biased ways which are uncorrelated with how good our actions actually
are. Some people don't pull the lever in the trolley problem because they would
feel like murderers, which leaves them with two dead bodies instead of one.
Other examples include the [identifiable victim
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect): you are
much more likely to donate to *some specific African kid whose name and story
you know* than to *support the same intervention when presented as a statistic*.
People are bad at naively making moral judgement. Our brains were built
for stone-age hunter-gatherer tribes, where the only moral impact your actions
had was on people you could actually meet and see. Obviously, this is no longer
the case today. Which is why many people would rather give $100 so that
Jane the blind child from across the street can afford a $35000 guide dog,
rather than support a charity which can save a human life for $3500, with the
only caveat being that you will probably never meet said saved human. Which
*makes you saving them and their parents and family from suffering and
the victim's death no less real*. Only less emotionally salient *to you*.)

So, step one. It matters a lot what you do with your resources if your goal is
to help others. (Actually, it matters a lot what you do with your resources *if
you have any particular goal at all*.)

Step two (at least for me) is: If it's THIS easy to help others, *how the hell
isn't Effective Altruism a global project with 50 years of history and
billions pledged in unanimous international support*? Why are our smartest
people working on optimizing ads on Facebook instead of on how to fix Earth?
And believe me, once you start looking, you see things to fix *everywhere*.
For starters: millions in poverty, diseases, cancer. Possible future risks we
know next to nothing about.  Aging, degenerative brain disease, death,
depression, malnutrition, nuclear stockpiles that could destroy the planet
X times over if [some immature narcissist in charge](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)
pushes the button one day, risk of bioterrorism, and I could go on for another
hour.

Read [Doing Good Better][doing-good-better]. The eminent philosopher Will
MacAskill gives the topic the attention it deserves.

I hereby swear that if I ever find myself writing a short intro to EA again,
I will just make it an article on our association's website :)

Our plan
==

Please excuse me if the previous paragraphs have been just me preaching to
the choir. I have been very vocal about my support of EA among my friends.

The first step in the [Czech Association for Effective Altruism][caea]'s plan
is organizing [EAGxPrague 2016][eagxprague] - the first conference on effective
altruism in Czech Republic. We are cooperating with the [Centre for Effective
Altruism][cea] to make it happen, and the cooperation is so fruitful I wouldn't
hesitate to claim it added a degree of magnitude to our expected impact.
It will be on *December 10, 2016* in [*Paralelní Polis*][pp].

My role is currently Director of the CAEA and Event Director of EAGxPrague 2016.

Yesterday, we finished every necessary preparation and we have just opened
applications ([in Czech][application-cz], [in English][application-en]).
If you'd like to find out about how can you contribute to making the world
better and if you're fairly close to Prague, I *highly encourage you to apply*.
We would be happy to meet you and talk.

I would be also very happy to hear any feedback from you at
[prague@eaglobalx.org](mailto:prague@eaglobalx.org), especially:

 * Do you know the important info? When and where will the conference be?
   What will it be about? What should you do if you want to go there?
 * Do you want to attend the conference given what you see on the website?
 * Did you find any parts of the application hard to understand?
 * Do you think some information you are looking for is hard to find on the
   website?
 * Is there anything about the website that confuses you, or makes you go
   "ugh"?
 * Do you know someone we should definitely talk to?
 * Do you have any suggestions for us?

The next steps in our plan are, roughly:

 * Do the conference and gather contacts to interested people there.
 * Do post-conference engagament - e.g., one-off talks, discussions, meet-ups,
   where we get to know each other better, and talk about our longer-term
   plans and strategy. Grow our member base.
 * Engage students at universities - teach them about Effective Altruism
   and invite them to our events.
 * Produce more EA material in Czech and post it on social media.
 * Think about longer-term strategy. For example: We will need to approach
   influencers at some point and try to persuade them. When will be the right
   time and how should we do that? Our operations will need some monetary
   resources. How can we gather those?

Our longer-term plan is mostly a black confused void, but that is OK.
We are not in a position to formulate sophisticated high-level strategy
given our current knowledge and manpower. Sophisticated high-level strategy
is important, but it's just fine if we define it and refine it step by step.
Unless there's some very unlikely crucial consideration we missed (e.g.,
promoting EA in Czech Republic might actually be a bad thing), most
high-level strategies would benefit from having more manpower, more resources
and more social backing for the EA idea. And this is an instrumental goal
our conference is pursuing. More proximally, the conference will innoculate
some influential and smart people with thinking about could we
improve the world, which is good (again, barring some exotic and unlikely
crucial consideration like "if smart people try to do good, they usually end
up doing bad").

So far, we're doing great.

I have a few observations I'd like to share.

Doing quick research
==

I have never worked on organizing a big event before, or did anything
entrepreurial-like or product-like.

One tool I have never used before, but that I'm starting to really enjoy using,
is *asking people what do they think*. Doing researchy and sciency things to
questions I'd like answered.

For example, yesterday we were thinking about which tagline would be best for
the conference. We had a short-list of 7 and couldn't choose among ourselves,
so I asked 9 of my friends to rate each on a 1-5 cool-uncool scale.

My methodology was the following:

 * For each friend, tell them the story ("So, you're walking down the uni
   hallway and you see a poster saying EAGxPrague with this tagline...")
   and I send them a random permutation of the answers to rate.
   The random permutation is important because people are highly biased
   to the order of information presentation and since we'll pick just one
   tagline, we want to remove this bias.
 * Then, we take their answers, average them out, and pick the best one.

One nice thing about this is that *it doesn't matter that the participants don't
use the same scale*: one participant might use the whole cool-uncool range of 1
to 5, another one might be just like "meh" and use just 3's or 4's.
There's no need to account for this. Because every study subject rates every
tagline, every subject's individual bias or scaling has the same effect on every
tagline's average score.

However, this means you can't really plot the final scores on a consistent
linear cool-to-uncool scale, because that would be a hodgepodge of several
different scales with different variances and means.
The way I use the final averages is twofold: A) *see the relative ordering
of taglines from good to bad*, and B) *roughly eyeball the size of the
difference*.

The scores of the different taglines were as follows: (N = 9. I acknowledge a
possible methodological gap in not calculating and working with the variances.
1 = cool, 5 = uncool.)

 * "Chytře za lepším světem" ("Smartly towards a better world"):  3.11
 * "Dělejme dobro lépe" ("Let's do good better"): 2.66
 * "Konference o efektivní pomoci" ("An conference on effective aid"): 3.0
 * "Máme úžasnou příležitost pomoci stovkám lidí. Jak na to?" ("We have a great opportunity to help hundreds of people. How can we do it?"): 3.22
 * "Skutečná řešení na skutečné problémy" ("Real solutions to real problems"): 3.0
 * "Skutečné problémy a jejich efektivní řešení" ("Real problems and their effective solutions"): 2.66
 * "Skutečné problémy, efektivní řešení" ("Real problems, effective solutions"): 3.0

Some things that surprised me here:

 * The size of the gap between "Real problems and their effective solutions"
   and "Real problems, effective solutions". Come on, it's just two short words
   versus a comma! Surprisingly, some subjects gave these two taglines
   a difference of a full 2 points.
 * That "Real problems and their effective solutions" did better
   than "Real problems, effective solutions". We (the 3 of us in the room
   at the time) liked the sound of the second one a bit better.

I'm afraid I'm unable to properly calculate the p-values for either of these
claims. They might very well be just noise. Our sample size is shit.

Still, we ended up going with "Real problems and their effective solutions",
at least for now, and I like playing the statistician/data scientist.
It's nice to have data to support your decision. One of my big TODO's for
the future is to get a better understanding of statistical tests, experiment
design and scientific methodology. Since math and CS at our uni was mostly
"definition, theorem, proof, repeat", we didn't get much of a background
in how does one formulate and test a hypothesis, and I think it's a very useful
and transferrable skill to have.

We used a pretty similar system to select which topics should we focus on at the
conference, and I'm glad we did. Initially, we thought we'd rather not talk too
much about far-future outcomes and global risks and that it would be better
to play up the animal advocacy angle, because our target group (students and
non-profits) would be easier to attract that way. Our survey's results surprised
me by putting animal advocacy well below global prioritization and far-future
outcomes. I have updated my belief in the sophistication of our attendees
upwards.

Estimating number of applicants
==

One problem we have had with the conference is that since it's the first EA
event in Czech Republic, there is little info from which we can infer how many
people will come.
Also, it is a problem with many variables: the amount depends on how
aggressively do we market the event, how high do we set the ticket cost,
and so on.

To make the amount of applicants as high as possible, we set the price low by
covering the losses with our own money and with sponsorships: standard price is
just 400 CZK, and students and people from the non-profit sector pay just
150 CZK (~$7).

The room we booked fits up to ~120 people and we would like to, ideally,
fill it.

Other pieces of information we have are:

 * We did a pre-conference event that we marketed minimally, just by sharing
   an event invitation by 3 people on Facebook. 15 people came there, we
   collected their e-mails and they were enthusiastic about the EAGxPrague
   idea.
 * The [LessWrong Group Prague on Facebook][lw-fb] has 97 members. I'd guess
   about 10 or so people come to most meetups.
 * The [Czech EA group on Facebook][czech-ea-fb] has 55 members. There's
   not too much intersection with the LW group.
 * Our venue, [Paralelní Polis][pp], will promote the event on [their Facebook
   page][pp-fb], which has ~11K likes.

Our hive-mind's estimates were that we could, optimistically, get about 80
people to attend. I am fairly certain this is a number that's based
on anchoring to the ~120-person capacity figure and then adjusting down
to account for not expecting to fully succeed.

I am optimistic. We are doing as much as we can.
We shall see later how well were we able to draw inferences on relatively little
information.

Planning
==

The most important tool [CEA][cea] gave us was a clear framework to use to plan
the goals of our conference, choose our target audience based on the goals,
choose a program that would fit and attract the target audience, and so on.
This transformed our fuzzy confused thinking into a clear picture where it's
easy to understand why exactly are we doing something. Where we previously had
"Oh, so we want to do a conference on EA and invite students, and I guess it
would be nice to also have some entrepreneurs and maybe do a giving game", we
now have "We want to build a solid EA base. To do that, we need people who have
time and energy to put into that. These are mostly students and non-profit
workers. To attract them, we need to do thing X, Y, Z and market through A, B,
C."

The importance of planning cannot be underestimated. I wish we started planning
properly as soon as the idea of a conference emerged. We would have saved
*months* of time spent doing less than effective work.

Personal status update
==

In the last ~2 weeks, I have been getting lots of self-esteem boosts, mostly I'd
guess from how well things are going for me work-wise and conference-wise
and thanks to some instances of unexpected acceptance, which had a soothing
therapeutic effect. My psychiatrist also recently doubled my citalopram to 40 mg
a day.

Unfortunately, in the last few days, I realized I made a huge mistake that
caused people I really care about a lot of pain, and that I had to fix it.
Now, I hate myself A) because I made the mistake in the first place,
B) because I hurt people by making the mistake, C) because the mistake
was probably just rooted in me trying to use other people to boost my
self-esteem and fear of abadonment, D) because I was too much of a coward
to even own up to my mistake and apparently subconsciously tried to shift
responsibility. At least that would be my interpretation. My depression came
back really hard in the last few days.

I have a few pieces of advise I want to give others who might be in a similar
position as me, that is, confusion about personal relationships:

 * Don't try to ignore away any nagging feelings in the back of your mind.
 * Never say anything like "I like you" or "I love you" or perform any actions
   associated with affection or love unless you are **absolutely sure** you
   are expressing your sincere emotion and that the message being broadcasted
   and the message being received are both as accurate as possible.
 * Never lie about your feelings to people you care about. Lying doesn't always
   feel like lying. Sometimes it just feels like a little pause before you
   say something, or a word you say while slightly twisting its meaning
   inside your head. Or it may be an action that carries an implicit meaning
   you may not realize.
 * Others may understand your emotions better than you yourself do. I haven't
   done that, but if you feel confused about what do you feel, you may try
   asking your friends. You may not notice verbal or behavioral clues you
   yourself broadcast, and others might.

The level of how OK I am depends on how much do I think about how stupid,
hurtful, abadoned, unacceptable and unlovable I am, and how much do I think
about the chances of that ever getting better. Right now, my level of OK-being
fluctuates between "too devastated to get up from the floor" and "so immersed
in exciting work that everything looks fine".
I'm not sure how long will this last, but I might be
somewhat-acceptably-OK-most-of-the-time again in a few weeks.

Until next time. Onwards!
