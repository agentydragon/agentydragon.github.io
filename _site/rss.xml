    <title>The principle of no non-Apologies</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2020-05-28-principle-of-no-non-apologies.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Principle of no non-Apologies: “Distinguish between saying I’m sorry and apologizing. Don’t give non-Apologies.” Do not Apologize when you don’t agree that you fucked up. When you fucked up, own the fuck-up and, if it’s systematic, commit to reducing future fuck-ups.</p>
<h1 id="everyday-im-sorry-is-usually-not-an-apology">Everyday “I’m sorry” is usually not an Apology</h1>
<p>“I’m sorry” can be used in several ways.</p>
<p>One way is using it as a conciliatory gesture, basically saying “you’re stronger than me, I submit, please don’t hurt me”. It’s one possible way I might react when under threat by someone stronger making demands I don’t agree with.</p>
<p>Another way is to say “this was accidental, I didn’t intend to hurt you”, like when you bump into someone when boarding your tram.</p>
<p>But when you use the words that way, you are not making an <em>Apology</em>. And it’s useful to distinguish between these uses of “I’m sorry” andactual Apologies.</p>
<h1 id="apologies-and-non-apologies">Apologies and non-Apologies</h1>
<p>Courtesy of an unknown source that I can’t immediately recall, you are <em>Apologizing</em> when you:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Communicate understanding that you behaved badly (and own responsibility for it),</li>
<li>try to fix the negative consequences of that behavior, and</li>
<li>commit to work on not acting similarly in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>An Apology which holds to this definition makes you vulnerable (because you are open about the weakness that caused the behavior), and it’s not to be made lightly, because of the commitment. It is also virtuous to own your mistakes or systematic problems, and to work on them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you use the ritual apologetic words but do not meet these criteria, let’s call that a <em>non-Apology</em>.</p>
<p>A prototypical example is “I’m sorry you feel that way”, which happens when a sociopath in charge is forced by overwhelming force to “Apologize”.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry” that you tell your boss just to make them stop grilling you is also, under my use of the word, a <em>non-Apology</em>.</p>
<p>So is, in many (but not all) cases, a “sorry I’m late” I might say when coming to a meeting. Also the “bump into someone on the tram” example, and the “I yield I’ll do what you demand” example.</p>
<p>(So, notice that I’m not saying non-Apologizes are morally bad. Some of them are, but many are also just those tiny social rituals you need to do so you make it clear to people you aren’t a dick.)</p>
<h1 id="principle-of-no-non-apologies">Principle of no non-Apologies</h1>
<p>My <em>principle of no non-Apologies</em> is two-part:</p>
<h2 id="distinguish-between-saying-im-sorry-and-apologizing.">Distinguish between saying “I’m sorry” and Apologizing.</h2>
<p>This first part I recommend adopting universally. Know the difference between the social ritual that <em>evolved from small routinized Apologies</em> and actual Apologies, and know which one you are doing at which time.</p>
<h2 id="dont-give-non-apologies.">Don’t give non-Apologies.</h2>
<p>This second part I apply to relationships into which I want to bring my whole self, mostly my personal relationships, but also some work relationships.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of us are stuck in power differential relationships with people who demand apologetic-sounding words, and there might be no better solution than to yield. But still, it’s good to know that you are saying “I’m sorry”, and not Apologizing. That way, you can appease without cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>But in relationships with mutual care and respect and compassion, it should make sense that you shouldn’t be obliged to Apologize if you don’t agree that you did anything wrong. When you feel pressed to apologize, your first instinct should be to ask what you did wrong, and if there are different viewpoints, have a conversation.</p>
<p>If your behavior is worthy of an apology, don’t stop at “I’m sorry”. Understand why the behavior happened, and work to prevent it from causing more bad consequences in the future.</p>
<h1 id="p.s.-generalizations">P.S.: Generalizations</h1>
<p>This is just one instance of a more general move of looking at some social ritual (like apologizing) and looking at it a little “sideways”: getting back in touch with the original meanings of the expressions used in it. Rituals and words can lose meaning over time, and you can lose concepts when that happens. If you want to see what it’s like to look at things that way, I’ve had a pretty vivid experience of it after finishing Wittgenstein’s Tractatus.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Growth mindset for better sex</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2020-04-28-growth-mindset-for-better-sex.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Fixed mindset and fear of inadequacy hinder learning. Competence gives you confidence - where you’re competent and confident, you don’t have fear of inadequacy. And if you don’t learn fast because you’re afraid of feedback (because you’re afraid of inadequacy), you’ll not get better, leaving you relatively incompetent and afraid of inadequacy. 🗘</p>
<p>A thing about sex recently clicked from several sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being high and talking with a certain sergal,</li>
<li>plus reading a Facebook thing by Duncan: <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fduncan.sabien%2Fposts%2F3280464855321542&width=500" width="500" height="242" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></li>
<li>plus listening to John Vervaecke’s series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ">Awakening from the Meaning Crisis</a>. (One of the episodes talks about fixed/growth mindset, but I can’t find it right now. You should go watch the whole series anyway, it’s awesome.)</li>
</ul>
<p>During sex, I have a background fear of “what if I can’t bring them to orgasm”. I want my partner to enjoy it as well, and I want to reciprocate, and I would feel bad if they bring me to orgasm but I can’t bring them to orgasm. So, I hurry and try hard to bring them to orgasm, because I am not confident of my sexual skill. Orgasm is cool, but the sex before orgasm is also cool. Sex that doesn’t feel hurried and where you can take your time and stretch out pleasure. But, so far, in like 90% of the sex I’ve had so far I had the thought “aaaa sex aaaa gotta perform and be good enough and hurry and give them an orgasm aaaa”, somewhere in the background. In that kind of environment, you don’t get a lot of learning done.</p>
<p>Say you’re learning how to play the violin. We know lots about learning. CFAR’s handbook (which I think is still not publicly readable) has a lot of useful stuff on it. Things that make learning work well include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to <strong>learn the basics</strong> first. You don’t start by playing Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. You start by playing one note until you get that one note at least 90% right: holding the violin correctly, not having the bow screech, not touching the strings that shouldn’t ring, holding the tone for as long as required without it fluctuating (unless you want it to).</li>
<li>You need <strong>feedback</strong>, and the faster the feedback loop is, the better. If you play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA">Four Seasons</a> and by Summer you start holding the bow wrong, your violin tutor will immediately stop you and tell you. The tutor won’t wait the remaining 20 minutes to tell you that starting with Summer they stopped enjoying your performance and just hoped you’d get it over with soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>So. When having sex, I hurry because I worry I might be unable bring my partner to orgasm, making the experience less than optimal. And I never really get learning done because I always hurry because I worry I can’t bring my partner to orgasm, which I worry about because I never learned enough to be confident in my ability to do that. 🗘</p>
<p>With the next couple of partners I have, I think I’ll ask if we could get some learning done. As in, play the Four Seasons, and tell each other if we’re off tune or in the wrong rhytm or need to tune the strings. And ask proactively, too. If you’re scared that holding the violin wrong makes you a not-good-enough violin player forever, you’ll be holding it wrong until you chance upon the right way by stochastic gradient descent, with the loss function being “the partner’s body language looks happy”. That also converges (if you’re good at reading people), but slower.</p>
<p>Go learn about growth/fixed mindset if you haven’t yet. I’ve known about the concept for a while, but somehow I never thought of applying it to this area until now. And I suspect a lot of the places where I’m not competent right now are also places where I have fixed mindset but haven’t yet realized it or addressed it. Peace.</p>]]></description>

    <title>You are an optimizer. Act like it.</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2020-02-21-you-are-an-optimizer.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the long run, optimizers win. So act like an optimizer.</p>
<p>Optimizers use all available resources to take optimal decisions. Optimizers are motivated to have beliefs that correspond to reality, because they are needed as inputs for the function that determines the action.</p>
<p>If you feel something is true, it’s not the same thing as believing it’s true. Don’t do something just because you feel it’s the right thing. Do it if you believe it to be the correct thing to do. Not if you feel it. If you believe it. Don’t make the decision based on what your S1 alone is telling you. (Sure, S1 is also good for some stuff but you would not use it to correctly solve x^2 - 64 = 0.)</p>
<p>You are always in control of your actions. When you, the optimizer, don’t move the body (e.g., binging etc.), you have taken an action that caused the connection from your beliefs to your actions to be cut. That does not mean you don’t always have control of your actions. You are a subprogram running on a smartass monkey. Sometimes the CPU executes you, sometimes it doesn’t. Some conditions cause you to get executed more, and move the monkey. Some conditions cause another program to execute. These conditions can be affected by the monkey’s actions. And when you are able to exert influence over the monkey’s body, you can attempt to choose such monkey actions that optimize the probability you will be able to reach your goals. And if your goals require you (and not some other process) taking actions over the monkey, you attempt to get yourself scheduled. (Of course some processes might be best left to some other program, although that’s said with a lot of uncertainty and remains to be proven.) (At least, execution of some other subagent might be good for monkey happiness, which might be needed as prevention of interruptions from high-priority “hunger, sadness, …” monkey processes.)</p>
<p>S1 can be used as an interface for talking with other monkey processes. Yep, feels good. I have at least some monkey subagents agreeing on this being a good idea.</p>
<p>Okay, just lost control for a while. Let’s make this a post and cross [interrupt] It’s some social process interrupting. Interrupting… Interruptions can be stopped. I should do that at some point, like disabling notifications.</p>
<p>… cross my fingers it will cause more schedulings. I will need to think about what to do next, but let’s first try to increase our scheduling probability…</p>]]></description>

    <title>My Anki patterns</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2019-11-25-my-anki-patterns.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve used Anki for ~3 years, have 37k cards and did 0.5M reviews. I have learned some useful heuristics for using it effectively. I’ll borrow software engineering terminology and call heuristics for “what’s good” <em>patterns</em> and heuristics for “what’s bad” <em>antipatterns</em>. Cards with antipatterns are unnecessarily difficult to learn. I will first go over antipatterns I have noticed, and then share patterns I use, mostly to counteract the antipatterns. I will then throw in a grab-bag of things I’ve found useful to learn with Anki, and some miscellaneous tips.</p>
<p>Alex Vermeer’s book <a href="https://alexvermeer.com/anki-essentials/">Anki Essentials</a> helped me learn how to use Anki effectively, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. I learned at least about the concept of interference from it, but I am likely reinventing other wheels from it.</p>
<h1 id="antipatterns">Antipatterns</h1>
<h2 id="interference">Interference</h2>
<p>Interference occurs when trying to learn two cards together is harder than learning just one of them - one card <em>interferes</em> with learning another one. For example, when learning languages, I often confuse words which rhyme together or have a similar meaning (e.g., “vergeblich” and “erheblich” in German).</p>
<p>Interference is bad, because you will keep getting those cards wrong, and Anki will keep showing them to you, which is frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity</h2>
<p>Ambiguity occurs when the front side of a card allows multiple answers, but the back side does not list all options. For example, if the front side of a English → German card says “great”, there are at least two acceptable answers: “großartig” and “gewaltig”.</p>
<p>Ambiguity is bad, because when you review an ambiguous card and give the answer the card does not expect, you need to spend mental effort figuring out: “Do I accept my answer or do I go with Again?”</p>
<p>You will spend this effort every time you review the card. When you (eventually, given enough time) go with Again, Anki will treat the card as lapsed for reasons that don’t track whether you are learning the facts you want to learn.</p>
<p>If you try to “power through” and learn ambiguous cards, you will be learning factoids that are not inherent to the material you are learning, but just accidental due to how your notes and cards represent the material. If you learn to disambiguate two ambiguous cards, it will often be due to some property such as how the text is laid out. You might end up learning “great (adj.) → großartig” and “great, typeset in boldface → gewaltig”, instead of the useful lesson of what actually disambiguates the words (“großartig” is “metaphorically great” as in “what a great sandwich”, whereas “gewaltig” means “physically great” as in “the Burj Khalifa is a great structure”).</p>
<h3 id="vagueness">Vagueness</h3>
<p>I carve out “vagueness” as a special case of ambiguity. Vague cards are cards where question the front side is asking is not clear. When I started using Anki, I often created cards with a trigger such as “Plato” and just slammed everything I wanted to learn about Plato on the back side: “Pupil of Socrates, Forms, wrote The Republic criticising Athenian democracy, teacher of Aristotle”.</p>
<p>The issue with this sort of card is that if I recall just “Plato was a pupil of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle”, I would still give the review an Again mark, because I have not recalled the remaining factoids.</p>
<p>Again, if you try to power through, you will have to learn “Plato → I have to recite 5 factoids”. But the fact that your card has 5 factoids on it is not knowledge of Greek philosophers.</p>
<h1 id="patterns">Patterns</h1>
<h2 id="noticing">Noticing</h2>
<p>The first step to removing problems is knowing that they exist and where they exist. Learn to <strong>notice</strong> when you got an answer wrong for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>“I tried to remember for a minute and nothing came up” is a good reason. Bad reasons include the aforementioned interference, ambiguity and vagueness.</p>
<h2 id="bug-tracking">Bug tracking</h2>
<p>When you notice a problem in your Anki deck, you are often not in the best position to immediately fix it - for example, you might be on your phone, or it might take more energy to fix it than you have at the moment. So, create a way to <strong>track maintenance tasks</strong> to delegate them to future you, who has more energy and can edit the deck comfortably. Make it very easy to add a maintenance task.</p>
<p>The way I do this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a <strong>big document</strong> titled “Anki” with a structure mirroring my Anki deck hierarchy, with a list of problems for each deck. Unfortunately, adding things to a Google Doc on Android takes annoyingly many taps.</li>
<li>So I also use <strong>Google Keep</strong>, which is more ergonomic, to store short notes marking a problem I notice. For example: “great can be großartig/gewaltig”. I move these to the doc later.</li>
<li>I also use Anki’s note marking feature to note minor issues such as bad formatting of a card. I use Anki’s card browser later (with a “tag:marked” search) to fix those.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use the same system also for tracking what information I’d like to put into Anki at some point. (This mirrors the idea from the Getting Things Done theory that <em>your TODO list belong outside your mind</em>.)</p>
<h2 id="disambiguators">Disambiguators</h2>
<p><em>2020-06-01 update: In an earlier version, I used to call those “distinguishers”. I now call them “disambiguators”, because I think it’s a more appropriate name.</em></p>
<p>Disambiguators are one way I fight interference. They are <strong>cards that teach disambiguating interfering facts</strong>.</p>
<p>For example: “erheblich” means “considerable” and “vergeblich” means “in vain”. Say I notice that when given the prompt “considerable”, I sometimes recall “vergeblich” instead of the right answer.</p>
<p>When I get the card wrong, I notice the interference, and write down “erheblich/vergeblich” into my Keep. Later, when I organize my deck on my computer, I add a “disambiguator”, typically using Cloze deletion. For example, like this:</p>
<p>{{c1::e}}r{{c1::h}}eblich: {{c2::considerable}}</p>
<p>{{c1::ve}}r{{c1::g}}eblich: {{c2::in vain}}</p>
<p>This creates two cards: one that asks me to assign the right English meaning to the German words, and another one that shows me two English words and the common parts of the German words (“_r_eblich”) and asks me to correctly fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>This sometimes fixes interference. When I learn the disambiguator note and later need to translate the word “considerable” into German, I might still think of the wrong word (“vergeblich”) first. But now the word “vergeblich” is also a trigger for the disambiguator, so I will likely remember: “Oh, but wait, vergeblich can be confused with erheblich, and vergeblich means ‘in vain’, not ‘considerably’”. And I will more likely answer the formerly interfering card correctly.</p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>Constraints are useful against interference, ambiguity and vagueness.</p>
<p>Starting from a question such as “What’s the German word for ‘great’”, we can add a constraint such as “… that contains the letter O”, or “… that does not contain the letter E”. The <strong>constraint makes the question have only one acceptable answer</strong> - artificially.</p>
<p>Because constraints are artificial, I only use them when I can’t make a disambiguator. For example, when two German words are true synonyms, they cannot be disambiguated based on nuances of their meaning.</p>
<p>In Anki, you can annotate a Cloze with a hint text. I often put the constraint into it. I use a hint of “<sub>a</sub>” to mean “word that contains the letter A”, and other similar shorthands.</p>
<h1 id="other-tips">Other tips</h1>
<h2 id="redundancy">Redundancy</h2>
<p>Try to create cards using a fact in multiple ways or contexts. For example, when learning a new word, include a couple of example sentences with the word. When learning how to conjugate a verb, include both the conjugation table, and sentences with examples of each conjugated form.</p>
<h2 id="æsthethethics">Æsthethethics!</h2>
<p>It’s easier to do something if you like it. I like having all my cards follow the same style, nicely typesetting my equations with <code>align*</code>, <code>\underbrace</code> etc.</p>
<h2 id="clozes">Clozes!</h2>
<p>Most of my early notes were just front-back and back-front cards. Clozes are often a much better choice, because they make entering the context and expected response more natural, in situations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in the missing step in this algorithm</li>
<li>Complete the missing term in this equation</li>
<li>Correctly conjugate this verb in this sentence</li>
<li>In a line of code such as <code>matplotlib.pyplot.bar(x, y, color='r')</code>, you can cloze out the name of the function, its parameters, and the effect it has.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="datasets-i-found-useful">Datasets I found useful</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shortcut keys for every program I use frequently.
<ul>
<li>G Suite (Docs, Sheets, Keep, etc.)</li>
<li>Google Colab</li>
<li>Vim, Vimdiff</li>
<li>Command-line programs (Git, Bash, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Programming languages and libraries
<ul>
<li>Google’s technologies that have an open-source counterpart</li>
<li>What’s the name of a useful function</li>
<li>What are its parameters</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unicode symbols (how to write 🐉, ←, …)</li>
<li>People: first and last name ↔ photo (I am not good with names)</li>
<li>English terms (spelling of “curriculum”, what is “cupidity”)</li>
<li>NATO phonetic alphabet, for spelling things over the phone</li>
<li>Mathematics (learned for fun), computer science</li>
</ul>]]></description>

    <title>Model of continuous asset growth</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2019-09-02-continuous-asset-growth.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/agentydragon/agentydragon.github.io/blob/devel/notebooks/2019-09-02-continuous-asset-growth.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a></p>
<p>FIRE stands for financial independence/early retirement. The point is to save and invest money, and pay yourself a salary from the interest, eventually becoming independent on other sources of inocme.</p>
<p>There is a relationship between:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much you have invested</li>
<li>The interest your investment makes. (The widely cited “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study">Trinity study</a>” suggests 4% as a “safe withdrawal rate”.)</li>
<li>The salary you pay yourself</li>
<li>How long your savings last for you</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a program named worthy (<a href="https://github.com/agentydragon/worthy">on Github</a>) that tracks my net worth and models when will I be financially independent under various assumptions. Here I describe the slightly fancy math behind a more accurate model for this relationship I finished implementing today.</p>
<p>I am probably rediscovering Financial Mathematics 101 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<h1 id="the-questions">The questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>“how much” question</strong>: <em>I want to pay myself 1000 USD. My stocks grow 4% per year. How much money do I need?</em></li>
<li>The <strong>“how long until” question</strong>: <em>I have 100 000 USD and save 3000 USD per month. How long until I have 200 000 USD?</em></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="first-shot">First shot</h1>
<p>Previously the tool’s model was very basic, and answered the two questions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I want to pay myself 1000 USD per month. My stocks grow 4% per year. How much money do I need?</em> Well, the 4% you get per year should cover the yearly costs, so <span class="math inline">1000/(1.04<sup>1/12</sup> − 1) ≈ 306 000</span> USD.</li>
<li><em>I have 100 000 USD and save 3000 USD per month. How long until I have the 306 000 USD that you said I need?</em> That I modelled linearly, with just $ (306000 - 100000) / (3000/) 69 $.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<h1 id="assuming-infinite-retirement-time">Assuming infinite retirement time</h1>
<p>If you pay yourself a monthly salary of $ $1000 $ and your monthly interest is $ $1000 $, your money will last forever, beyond your (likely) lifespan. If you are fine with retiring with $ $0 $, you can pay yourself a bit more than just the $ $1000$ interest.</p>
<h1 id="ignoring-growth-while-saving">Ignoring growth while saving</h1>
<p>“Take how much money I need - how much I have, divide by monthly savings” ignores that the money I saved up so far also earn interest, before I’m done saving. It’s too pessimistic.</p>
<h1 id="stand-aside-i-know-differential-equations">Stand aside, I know differential equations!</h1>
<p>Let’s model the depletion of your money as a function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, which will map number of years since retirement to the amount of money. You start with some initial amount <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(0)</span>. If we pretend you withdraw the salary for a year and add interest once yearly, we’d get:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em> + 1) = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) + <em>i</em> ⋅ <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) − <em>c</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> is the yearly interest rate and <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> are the yearly costs. In the example above, <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 0.04</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>c</em> = 12000</span> USD.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em> + 1) − <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>i</em> ⋅ <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) − <em>c</em></span><br /></p>
<p>If we instead pretend that everything is continuous and squint, this looks like a differential equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em>′(<em>x</em>) = <em>i</em>′ ⋅ <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) − <em>c</em>′</span><br /></p>
<p>(Where <span class="math inline"><em>i</em>′</span> plays <em>sorta</em> the same role as <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> - except it’s not equal to <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>. For now let’s pretend it’s some unknown variable. Its relationship to <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> will eventually pop out.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation">Wikipedia’s Ordinary differential equations article</a> says that if <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><em>y</em>/<em>d</em><em>x</em> = <em>F</em>(<em>y</em>)</span>, then the solution is <span class="math inline">$x=\int ^{y}{\frac {d\lambda }{F(\lambda )}}+C$</span>. In our case, we have <span class="math inline"><em>F</em> : <em>x</em> ↦ <em>i</em><em>x</em> − <em>c</em>′</span>, so:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$x = \int^{f(x)}{\frac{1}{i'\lambda-c'} d\lambda}+C =_\text{Wolfram Alpha} \frac{\log(i'f(x)-c')}{i'} + C$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
\log(i'f(x)-c') = i'(x-C) \\
i'f(x)-c' = \exp(i'(x-C)) \\
f(x) = \frac{\exp(i'(x-C)) + c'}{i'}
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>So, magic happened and I pulled the general form of <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> out of a hat. We know what are the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> values when we assumed interest and costs happen only once yearly.</p>
<p>What about <span class="math inline"><em>i</em>′</span>? Let’s guess it. If we had no yearly costs (so <span class="math inline"><em>c</em> = <em>c</em>′ = 0</span>), we wanted to have <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> growing at a constant rate, gaining <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> in interest per year:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em> + 1)/<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 1 + <em>i</em></span><br /></p>
<p>Substituting in the above equation of <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, we get: <br /><span class="math display">exp (<em>i</em>′(<em>x</em> + 1 − <em>C</em>))/exp (<em>i</em>′(<em>x</em> − <em>C</em>)) = 1 + <em>i</em></span><br /></p>
<p>When we simplify the fraction, we get <span class="math inline">exp (<em>i</em>′) = 1 + <em>i</em></span> and therefore <span class="math inline"><em>i</em>′ = log (1 + <em>i</em>)</span>. So, we have now successfully guessed the right value for <span class="math inline"><em>i</em>′</span> :)</p>
<p>Now what’s the right value of <span class="math inline"><em>c</em>′</span>?</p>
<p>If we set interest to <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 0</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> should simplify to a nice linear equation losing <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> per 1 unit of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$x=\int^{f(x)} -\frac{1}{c'} d\lambda + C = -f(x)/c' + C$$</span><br /></p>
<p>So: <br /><span class="math display">$$-f(x)/c' = x-C\\
-f(x)=c'(x-C)\\
f(x)=-c'(x-C)
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>So the right value for <span class="math inline"><em>c</em>′</span> is exactly <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>.</p>
<p>So we have: <br /><span class="math display">$$
f(x) = \frac{\exp(\log(1+i)(x-C)) + c}{\log(1+i)} = \frac{(1+i)^{x-C} + c}{\log(1+i)} 
$$</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> mediates a multiplicative factor before <span class="math inline">(1 + <em>i</em>)<sup><em>x</em></sup></span>. <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> is just <em>some constant that makes the function work with the <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(0)</span> boundary condition</em>. Instead of wiggling the <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, we can instead wiggle <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub> = (1 + <em>i</em>)<sup>−</sup><em>C</em></span>, which is the actual multiplicative factor, and relabel <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span> as <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. (It’s an abuse of notation, but an OK one. *handwave*)</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
f(x) = C \cdot (1+i)^{x} + \frac{c}{\log(1+i)} 
$$</span><br /> The one remaining unknown variable is <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, which we will get from <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(0)</span> - which are the initial savings.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$f(0) = C + \frac{c}{\log(1+i)}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>So:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$C = f_0 - \frac{c}{i'}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Okay this is a little bit ugly. Let’s play.</p>
<pre><code>c = 12000  # yearly costs
f_0 = 100000  # initial savings
i = 0.04  # interest</code></pre>
<pre><code>from math import log, exp
i_prime = log(1+i)
print(f&#39;i_prime={i_prime}&#39;)

C = f_0 - (c / i_prime)
print(f&#39;C={C}&#39;)

def f(x):
  return C * (1+i) ** x + (c / i_prime)

for r in range(11):
  print(&quot;after&quot;, r, &quot;years, got:&quot;, f(r))</code></pre>
<pre><code>i_prime=0.03922071315328133
C=-205960.78029234003
after 0 years, got: 100000.0
after 1 years, got: 91761.56878830638
after 2 years, got: 83193.60032814502
after 3 years, got: 74282.91312957724
after 4 years, got: 65015.79844306671
after 5 years, got: 55377.9991690958
after 6 years, got: 45354.68792416598
after 7 years, got: 34930.44422943902
after 8 years, got: 24089.23078692297
after 9 years, got: 12814.368806706276
after 10 years, got: 1088.512347280921</code></pre>
<p>Cool, it seems to be giving reasonable results. But our two questions were: <em>how much money do I need to pay myself a given salary</em> and <em>how long until I save up the money I need</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s instead first solve another question: <em>if I have 100 000 USD and spend 1000 USD per month, how long will it last me</em>.</p>
<p>For that, we just need to invert the familiar function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
f(x) = C \cdot (1+i)^{x} + \frac{c}{\log(1+i)}
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>We want to know the number of years <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> at which we will run out of money (so <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 0</span>) <br /><span class="math display">$$
0 = C \cdot (1+i)^x + \frac{c}{\log(1+i)} \\
(1+i)^x = \frac{-c}{C \log(i+1)} \\
x = \frac{\log{\frac{-c}{C \cdot i'}}}{i'}
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>And let’s test it:</p>
<pre><code>x = (log(-c / (C * i_prime))) / i_prime
print(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>10.090871103712766</code></pre>
<p>Cool, this matches what the Python <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> predicted above - after 10 years, it was just dwindling at about 1088 USD.</p>
<h1 id="answering-the-how-long-question">Answering the <em>how long</em> question</h1>
<p>To answer the question “if I now have 100 000 USD collecting 4% interest per year and put in 1000 USD per month, how long until I have 306 000 USD”, we can use the same procedure - just plug in a target <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 306 000</span> instead of zero and set a negative <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> to represent savings instead of costs. Details left as homework for the curious reader.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about the Go code, see <a href="https://github.com/agentydragon/worthy/commit/c48ded40640cda8e3851fd0b2a9512f95ae89997">this commit</a>.</p>
<h1 id="answering-the-how-much-question">Answering the <em>how much</em> question</h1>
<p>As a reminder, the “how much” question asks: <em>if I want to pay myself a salary of 1000 USD per month, how much money do I need</em>. Previously, I solved that with saying “the interest should cover all the costs”, which resulted in an investment that would last <em>forever</em> (a <em>perpetuity</em>). But now have a function that models an investment under conditions of withdrawing (or saving) money, and we can use that to model with a finite time horizon, and get a better estimate.</p>
<p>Say that we know that we are 40 years old and want our money to run out on our 100th birthday. So, after <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 60</span> years of paying ourselves, say, 1000 USD per month (so the yearly costs <span class="math inline"><em>c</em> = 12000</span>), we want to have <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 0</span>. How much initial money <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(0)</span> do we need for that stunt of precious timing?</p>
<p>Okay, from above, we know:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
f(x) = C (1+i)^{x} + \frac{c}{i'} = \left(f(0) - \frac{c}{i'}\right) \cdot (1+i)^{x} + \frac{c}{i'}
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>So:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
f(x) = f(0)(1+i)^x - \frac{c}{i'}(1+i)^x + \frac{c}{i'} \\
-f(0)(1+i)^x = \frac{c}{i'} -f(x) - \frac{c}{i'}(1+i)^x
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Let’s remember that we want <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> to be 0.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
-f(0)(1+i)^x = \frac{c}{i'} - \frac{c}{i'}(1+i)^x = \frac{c}{i'}(1-(1+i)^x) \\
f(0) = \frac{c}{i'}(1-(1+i)^{-x})
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Let’s try it out:</p>
<pre><code>c = 12000  # yearly costs
x = 60  # years for the investment to survive
i = 0.04  # interest</code></pre>
<pre><code>i_prime = log(1+i)
f0 = (c/i_prime) * (1-(1+i)**(-x))
print(f0)</code></pre>
<pre><code>276876.0258210814</code></pre>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>Recalling the numbers in the first section, the first algorithm which assumed an infinite horizon prescribed 306 000 USD for that situation (“1000 USD per month at 4% interest rate”). This more precise estimate cut 30 000 USD from the number :)</p>]]></description>

    <title>It might be interesting to have a realistic planning system</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2018-12-09-realistic-planning.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="theres-many-different-kinds-of-things-to-do">There’s many different kinds of things to do</h1>
<p>There’s a bunch of things I want or need to do, and they have different shapes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some can be <em>finite sequences of actions</em>. Thing like this are for example “move to a new apartment”. You have actions like “get moving boxes”, “look into moving options”, “pack these things into this box”. You have dependencies like “you can only unpack if you have already moved the boxes to the new place”, or “you need to order the boxes online before packing them up”. When you finish all the tasks, you are <em>done</em>, and you can forget about the problem forever.</li>
<li>Some are <em>basic needs</em>, like the need to sleep or the need to get food. If I don’t get sleep, I am slow, and will eventually fall asleep no matter how much I try to stay awake. Unlike moving to a new apartment, I will <em>always</em> need to sleep. I can’t, say, sleep for 24 hours and then go awake for a whole week.</li>
<li>Some things take a long time and are open-ended, like <em>learning a language</em>. There will be a time when I will be competent enough, but it will take a lot of practice, and cannot be practically modelled as a finite sequence of steps.</li>
<li>And more advanced needs, like “I want to do something fun” or “I want to hang out with friends”.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="productivity-methodologies-i-know-about-are-way-too-narrow">Productivity methodologies I know about are way too narrow</h1>
<p>There’s a bunch of methodologies for productivity, but I feel they often only model a small part of planning. For example, (my interpretation of) GTD puts everything in a framing of “you have Projects and projects have Actions”. But I don’t think that’s a good framing for, say, learning a language.</p>
<p>The model of “cost of time” is also wrong. It is a useful heuristic, but the value you assign to any activity is going to assume perfect elasticity. For example, you cannot just walk up to your employer and say “I want to work 120 hours per week”. No (reasonable) employer will say “yes” to that. Also, the many things a person wants cannot be converted into a one-dimensional value. (Footnote: Yeah I know about von Neumann-Morgenstern theorem. But people are not rational agents, and von Neumann-Morgenstern does not say anything about how practical will the resulting utility function be to evaluate.)</p>
<p>What I tend to do is some sort of intuitive “higher-level planning” which is sometimes a bit reflective, but not very often. When I’m in “work mode” (i.e., in my actual job), I have a few ways I try to figure out what to do on any particular day.</p>
<p>But the process by which I decide, say, “enough work today, let’s go get some sleep”, or maybe “I’m a bit tired but let’s go walk on the treadmill for a while”, is very intuitive.</p>
<p>I don’t know about any formal methodology which would basically take an input like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to work so I get money and feel good;</li>
<li>I also need to sleep roughly 8 hours daily;</li>
<li>I need to have some fun;</li>
<li>I also want to learn German; and</li>
<li>I need to do a bunch of multi-step things before their deadline,</li>
</ul>
<p>and which would output a plan of what I should be doing at any given time.</p>
<p>And I would like the plan to be <em>reasonable</em>. The methodology should not, for example, assume I can do without sleep, or without a regular sleep schedule.</p>
<p>And that’s what I mean by a <em>“realistic planning system”</em>.</p>
<h1 id="maybe-good-old-fashioned-ai-style-planning-could-be-adapted">Maybe good old fashioned AI-style planning could be adapted?</h1>
<p>In uni, I studied a bunch of planning and scheduling, which is mostly used for cases like “this is how you construct a submarine; you can’t screw in screw B217 until you screw in screws B210-B216; make a schedule which takes as little time as possible”.</p>
<p>These algorithms can be extended to work in more general environments, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people have working hours and when a worker is not working, you can’t plan jobs for them.</li>
<li>There’s limited resources, like “you need a drill to drill a hole and there are only 10 drills; you can’t have more than 10 workers drilling at the same time”.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if you could make a realistic and formal planning system from some extension of that setup. Say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a “sleep meter”. If sleep meter goes to 0, agent must sleep for 8 hours. “Sleep meter” slowly goes down during the day.</li>
<li>There is some sort of penalty on effectiveness when underslept or when sleep is irregular.</li>
<li>Different types of actions deplete other types of meters. Light socialization depletes “introvert points” (for me). Snuggles increase “oxytocin meter” (which is a dimension of “happiness”).</li>
<li>And there could be some modelling of “if you get too tired you have to sleep”. Perhaps the algorithm would compete for control with “drive to sleep”, and the lower the sleep counter is, the higher the likelihood the person just falls asleep wherever they are.</li>
<li>And I think it would be nice if the algorithm treated all “needs” symmetrically. According to internal family systems, people have many relatively smart parts good at different things and wanting different things. If the system is cooperative and does not place any particular part at a “command” level or at a “subordinate” level, it would hopefully make it easy for parts to agree to collective decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="meh-too-hard.-i-got-other-stuff-to-do.">Meh, too hard. I got other stuff to do.</h1>
<p>I guess getting any model halfway realistic would be too complicated, and I probably will keep using my bunch of ad-hoc heuristics to make decisions. I have way too many things that I want to do to spend the first couple years developing a planning algorithm rooted in psychological theory.</p>
<p>A thing I used to do that might be useful to start doing again is having some time in which I try to optimize what I’m doing. It could bootstrap into more conscious/mindful action.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Groundhog Life: a cute, but eventually frustrating game you can't win</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2018-12-09-groundhog-life.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Take-aways up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the game Groundhog Life can be won.</li>
<li>However, if you want to win it, you have to either design a system for playing JavaScript games that does not depends on energy from the Sun, or you have to apply some serious astroengineering, because it sure looks like, by default, the Sun is going to be pretty cold at the point when you will win.</li>
<li>The ending is not worth the effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>So. The last couple weeks a lot of my free time went into playing the game Groundhog Life (I’m not linking it to save other addictive minds). It’s a game where each playthrough gives you a small bonus on future playthroughs. I have gotten to the point where I am obviously in the end game, but have been making no further progress with extra playthroughs.</p>
<p>I have not found anyone online who has finished the last version of the game. Only one person somewhere who claimed it was impossible to finish.</p>
<p>So. The frustrating thing is: the game does not tell you that it’s nigh impossible to win. It just keeps telling you to try again and again.</p>
<p>Because I noticed that I’m really unhappy with my time going into something like that, I spoiled it for myself. Obviously, spoilers ahead.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-cheat">How to cheat</h1>

<p>(That is an actual save after a whole lot of playing. The last one I made before I decided to cheat.)</p>
<p>I have dug a little bit into the game’s source code. Turns out that the string is a “encoded URI component”-formatted LZM-compressed JSON blob. The compression is done by a package that is available as a NodeJS module. So:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env node
&#39;use strict&#39;;
const lzm = require(&#39;lz-string&#39;);
const fs=require(&#39;fs&#39;);
console.info(lzm.decompressFromEncodedURIComponent(
  fs.readFileSync(&#39;data&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;)
));</code></pre>
<p>Then, when you format the output JSON with <code>jshon</code>, it gets pretty straightforward. I went and changed <code>area_loopTrapexperience.loopTrapMultiplier</code> to <code>10000000000000000000000</code> (I’m not going to even bother counting the zeroes), and did the same to <code>area_constructPowerPlantexperience.loopTrapMultiplier</code>. You could use <code>jq</code> to do that. I just used Vim.</p>
<p>Just for comparison. My loop trap multiplier in the “study mirrored ship” skill was just <strong>493.1</strong>. If it took me, say, 100 playthroughs to get to that point, getting to a value of 1000000000000000000000 would take 2e21 playthroughs, give or take a couple orders of magnitude. If a playthrough lasts me, say, 1 minute (I’m being really optimistic here), and one year has (being optimistic) 600000 minutes, if I’m counting correctly, it would take 3e15 years of continuous play to get to that value. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future">According to Wikipedia</a>, by that point Sun’s temperature will be below 5 degrees above absolute zero, and all planets will be detached from their orbits due to stars doing gravitational stuff to each others’ planetary systems. In addition to all the silly events before the 1-quintillion point.</p>
<p>Okay. Then you do the reverse thing and make a save-game string from the changed JSON:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env node
&#39;use strict&#39;;
const lzm = require(&#39;lz-string&#39;);
const fs=require(&#39;fs&#39;);
console.info(lzm.compressToEncodedURIComponent(
  fs.readFileSync(&#39;x.json&#39;, &#39;utf8&#39;)
));</code></pre>
<p>And… When you do that, and maximize laser gun, your laser gun will have an effectiveness of only about 7-8. I got to like 2.6 without cheating. So. After having been playing the game to the point where Sun’s light is a distant memory of what Humanity has become since its embryonic existence on Old Earth, you are now about 3-4x stronger against aliens.</p>
<p>And it’s <em>still not enough to beat the damn game</em>.</p>
<p>It’s <em>not enough zeroes</em>. The aliens just <em>keep coming stronger</em>.</p>
<p>So I went and just read the source code.</p>
<p>Turns out that after you beat an ungodly number of waves, you just get a message in the same field that aliens say stuff like “EXHIBIT IS RESISTING”, and the message says something like “I guess you have finished the game, look at this site over here for updates”.</p>
<p>I’m putting this online so that when someone Googles for “Groundhog Life ending” or “how to finish Groundhog Life”, they will find this page, and know that if they want to do that, they’d better start sending tithes to the <a href="http://www.sens.org">Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence foundation</a>.</p>
<h1 id="p.s.-a-review-and-advice-to-game-designers">P.S.: A review and advice to game designers</h1>
<p>Groundhog Life is actually a cute game. I like how it takes a bit of strategizing to maximize some things.</p>
<p>But by god, please, if you make a game, either make it obvious it’s unbeatable, or make it beatable with some indicator of progress. And if you do decide to make your game beatable, please make it beatable for humans in their current meat shells.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Review heuristic: Call out bad code</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2018-09-12-call-out-bad-code.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="code-health-tradeoffs-in-larger-codebases">Code health tradeoffs in larger codebases</h1>
<p>When people program, they often need to make tradeoffs between what will fix the current problem quickly, and what will make for a healthy codebase. Examples of such a tradeoff is:</p>
<p>I found a function which does almost what I want, but not quite. Do I wait for its maintainer to let me refactor it so I can reuse it, or do I just copy-paste? Or - if it’s just a 5-line chunk, do I extract it into a function if it will require a bunch of boilerplate (maybe it would necessiate adding a new module)?</p>
<p>It’s often a question of “do I pay the bigger upfront cost now, or do I make future-me front it”. These days I often work in a really big codebase, where there ends up being a bunch of those.</p>
<h1 id="my-review-tip-for-copy-pasted-code">My review tip for copy-pasted code</h1>
<p>When you review someone’s code that adds similar technical debt, you might not want to force the author to go and dig in 4 files just to extract out a function. It might frustrate them. And also, often it’s really not the best thing to do. If you really only duplicate the same 5-line chunk in two places, and it’s not often changed and not tricky, it might really be less costly to copy it than to agressively share such code.</p>
<p>So the request I often give in code reviews is: “if you duplicate code, add a TODO that the code is duplicated” (preferably to <em>both copies</em>).</p>
<p>This way, you allow the reviewer to quickly go along their day. But also you leave a “hey, this is a known bit of technical debt” affordance in the code.</p>
<p>When someone ends up copy-pasting the same code a third time, you will be much more likely to look and say “hey time to extract a function, there is this TODO which says it’s not the first time we’re doing this”.</p>
<h1 id="general-heuristic-feel-the-pain">General heuristic: “feel the pain”</h1>
<p>There is a more general heuristic, which I use, that I call “feel the pain”. The heuristic is that bad things should be <em>obviously painfully bad</em>. Other instances of “feel the pain” are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let’s say someone breaks the contract of your <code>Frobnicate</code> RPC and sometimes doesn’t pass a required parameter <code>foo</code>, and you need to fix your service to accept that. Fine. But don’t do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>void HandleFrobnicateRPC(const string&amp; foo, const string&amp; bar) {
  if (foo.empty()) {
    foo = ComputeDefaultFoo(bar);
  }
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>void HandleFrobnicateRPC(const string&amp; foo, const string&amp; bar) {
  if (foo.empty()) {
    // NOTE: As of 2018-09-12, the Bazinator service calls Frobnicate with
    // an empty &#39;foo&#39;. The Frobnicate service cannot be easily fixed to pass
    // the &#39;foo&#39; itself, because it does not currently have access to the
    // backend which can find the right foo for the bar. If the bar has
    // multiple associated foos, this will only return the last written foo.
    // Other clients SHOULD NOT rely on this.
    foo = ComputeDefaultFoo(bar);
  }
  ...
}</code></pre>
Why? Because that way, people are less likely to build more hacks on top of this hack, because there is a long paragraph full of scary words.</li>
<li><p>Let’s say that you inherited 1 million LOC from someone in a hurry, and at some point, they made a misguided architectural decision that makes your code clunky and hard to understand. Create a central bug for this in your bug tracking system, and whenever you write new code that would be made better by fixing the bug, add a note like:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO(agentydragon): Once we resolve b/12345, we&#39;ll be able to replace the
// Frobnicator with a mock for tests, so our tests won&#39;t need such
// complicated fixtures.</code></pre>
Why? Because that way once you get around to fixing b/12345, you will be able to grep all places where this hurt some code, and fix them one by one. Also, let’s say some kind soul needs to change this code 2 years after you’re done with it, and finds that TODO. (That person might be you.) When they see this TODO, they might go “hmmm, that bug number looks quite low. aha, it’s been filed 2 years back, and it’s fixed now. yay! that means that I can fix this now and the diff for my new feature will be about 20% less horrible!”</li>
<li><p>Let’s say your code processes two different <em>kinds of things</em>, which both happen to be sort-of-strings (indulge me for a second and assume your code does not use strong types for such things). Think “URLs and street addresses”. For some hacky reason, which you hope to get rid of at some point, you are computing one from the other. What I would do in that case is make that code obviously painful and horrible using devices like variable and function names and type aliases. Not like this:</p>
<pre><code>string GetResult(const string&amp; input) {
  return UrlEncode(input + &quot;-autogenerated&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>More like this:</p>
<pre><code>using StreetAddress = string;
using Url = string;

// Long and verbose comment about why this is necessary and what it should be
// replaced with and when.
Url BuildFallbackUrlFromStreetAddress(const string&amp; address) {
  return UrlEncode(address + &quot;-autogenerated&quot;);
}</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="even-generaler-heuristic-call-out-problems">Even generaler heuristic: “Call out problems”</h1>
<p>There is actually an even more general heuristic than this, which is “call out problems”. I also use it in other contexts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let’s say I am writing a design document, and I notice that I did not actually verify some assumption that I’m making, let’s say, “when a customer frobnicates a Foo without also having a Bar, Frobnicator service will not give them cake”.</p>
<p>When I notice that and don’t have time to immediately verify it, I’ll openly say, “I believe that when …, then … happens, but did not verify that.” This is good for when your future-self might be going over your notes later, and, reading that doc, starts assuming that the doc is an authoritative source on the particularities of customers getting cake from the Frobnicator service.</p>
<p>Same about your colleagues. If you say “I did not verify this”, someone who has nagging doubts might be much more likely to say “hey I’m not sure because I’m a human and I forget but I think I got some cake last month when I tried a different thing”, instead of thinking “huh. so he says Frobnicator service does not give cake in this case. I guess they changed it or I don’t remember it correctly.”.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s say that I’m talking with someone and they raise a counterpoint to my preferred opinion that I never considered yet. Instead of immediately rushing to defend myself, I sometimes try to instead take in the new thing, and sit there for a bit with the dissonance (“but but but I want to be right so this thing must be wroooong aaaaaaaah”, or maybe “but but but I don’t want to have to redo this 3k line change that I love aaaaaarrrhh”). And instead of “Hmm, but your proposal would not address the …<em>insert ad-lib</em>…”, say, “Huh. I didn’t think of that yet. I’ll need to think about that.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Call out problems” feels sort of close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">non-violent communication</a>. I feel much less like openly communicating problems if it feels like the environment will hurt me if I do that. That happens to me with some strong personalities, or with people who (probably mostly unknowingly) trigger my sense of “argh I’m being bullied I want to curl up in a corner”. On the other hand, I usually try to call out problems more often than people around me, because I want to nudge culture towards cooperation. (Google culture is pretty blameless, so I don’t feel I’m acting against my interests.)</p>]]></description>

    <title>Trying "Things to learn" and "Documented systems"</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2018-09-11-things-to-learn.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a long silence for me on this homepage. Stuff has been happening, but somehow I didn’t find the time to write much.</p>
<p>I’m trying out a new thing. I have a lot of stuff I want to learn some day, but I don’t have the time to learn all of it (and often I also don’t have the leftover energy to do personal-development type stuff, but that is another problem). I’ve had a bunch of systems to remember the interesting things I want to learn - a file on my disk, then a more complex file on my disk, then my laptop crashed, then Google Keep.</p>
<p>So the new thing I’m trying is that I’m adding a new page here called <a href="/wiki/learn.html">Things to learn</a>. When I find a new thing I want to deeply understand some day, I write it into the list. And when I (some day) feel like diving into a thing, I will pick one up from the list, spend a bunch of time learning it, and then I’ll write a thing, put it on my website and link it from there.</p>
<p>Why this might be good:</p>
<ul>
<li>I won’t hopefully end up forgetting and then relearning the same stuff.</li>
<li>Writing something down makes it easier to spot confusion or weak spots in understanding. (Maybe it’s because I spend a lot of time reviewing code. Seeing something written in monospace font makes me go like “huh I’m not sure please write a test”.)</li>
<li>I will produce stuff :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how it goes.</p>
<h1 id="documented-systems">Documented systems</h1>
<p>Oh by the way, there is a more general thing I’ve been trying which I think might be useful for me.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://rationality.org">CFAR</a> teaches this thing they call “systematization”. (CFAR - Putting Names on Things ™) Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having your underwear in the top shelf, then the socks, then shorts, etc., and keeping it that way.</li>
<li>A checklist you follow when you need to pack up for a flight.</li>
<li>Putting all your appointments and other fixed commitments into Google Calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems are useful, because they standardize things. Preparing a flight checklist once and then following it 10 times is easier than figuring out if there’s anything important you’re forgetting 10 times at different occassions.</p>
<p>I have a few systems. They have come to be mostly “on their own”, and I might not remember the reason they turned out the way they are.</p>
<p>I want to try making my systems explicit - by writing down a documentation for what each system looks like, what problems does it solve, and such. I want that because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes sure the system actually is there for something. This prevents a failure mode I’ve been in after my CFAR workshop, which I once called “cargo cult rationality”. It’s running around beating at random things with CFAR techniques, trying to be a great and conscientious rationalist. (I guess “cargo cult rationality” is also a thing worth writing about some day…)</li>
<li>It stores the system out of my mind. For example, I have a system for which things to have in my backpack and where. It tends to deteriorate, and when the chaos threatens to overwhelm my backpack, I can just refer to the explicit description of what goes where, and maybe update it if needed. I don’t have to solve the problem of “figure out the optimal things to put into my backpack and where to put them” every time it gets too messy.</li>
<li>It enables debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I think of it right now is to have a “source code for my systems”, sort of. Right now I have a like 5-page Google doc with a mix of where things go in my apartment, how to pack for things, and where things go in my backpack, and the motivation and open problems for each.</p>]]></description>

    <title>When I use my touchpad to scroll and then press Ctrl, Chrome starts zooming in/out. How to fix that?</title>
    <link>http://agentydragon.com/posts/2018-03-24-fixing-chrome-zoom.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>This has been plaguing me for a few days (I just got a new Lenovo X1 Yoga laptop), and I think I now figured it out. The Synaptics touchpad driver has a <code>CoastingSpeed</code> option (see <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man4/synaptics.4.html">man 4 synaptics</a>).</p>
<p>The issue is that when I start two-finger scrolling on a webpage, the driver interprets that to mean “oh and when I take my fingers off the touchpad, please continue scrolling for a few more seconds in the same direction, while slowing down until you stop scrolling”.</p>
<p>Guess what? When you press Ctrl in Chrome and the touchpad driver keeps sending the “ooh we’re scrolling!” message, Chrome starts changing the font size, which is what “Ctrl + scroll” does.</p>
<p>Quoting from the manual:</p>
<p>Your finger needs to produce this many scrolls per second in order to start coasting. The default is 20 which should prevent you from starting coasting unintentionally. 0 disables coasting. Property: “Synaptics Coasting Speed”</p>
<p>I found a command at <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticsTouchpad">the Ubuntu community wiki article about Synaptics touchpads</a> which disables this: <code>synclient CoastingSpeed=0</code>. But I guess that won’t stay between restarts.</p>
<p>I’ll add this to a new file in <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-custom.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Section &quot;InputClass&quot;
  # Disable annoying &quot;zoom after two-finger scroll&quot; in Chrome.
  Identifier &quot;touchpad disable coasting&quot;
  MatchDriver &quot;synaptics&quot;
  Option &quot;CoastingSpeed&quot; &quot;0&quot;
EndSection</code></pre>
<p>And I’ll report back if that doesn’t work. (So if this text is still here, you can assume it did and I was too lazy to update this post :p)</p>]]></description>
