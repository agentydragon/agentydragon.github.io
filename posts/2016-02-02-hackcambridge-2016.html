<p>Last weekend, I went to <a href="https://hackcambridge.com">HackCambridge</a> with <a href="http://hudecekpetr.cz">Petr</a> to hack on things. Some things could be organized a bit better (like the WiFi at the main venue being hilariously broken), but we ended up having a lot of fun. Luckily, a bunch of my homies from Dropbox also happen to study in Cambridge and it was great to catch up with them.</p>
<p>We built a cool game. It’s called <a href="https://deadlockempire.github.io"><em>The Deadlock Empire</em></a> and it lets you <em>slay dragons and learn concurrency</em> - what could me more awesome?!?!</p>
<p>Just look at this presentation!</p>

<p>It’s at <a href="https://deadlockempire.github.io" class="uri">https://deadlockempire.github.io</a>. You can laugh at our poor coding practices on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/deadlockempire/deadlockempire.github.io">deadlockempire/deadlockempire.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>The Deadlock Empire has a sequence of challenges for practicing concurrent thinking. Each challenge gives you several threads, each running their own source code in C#, and your objective is to play <em>the mischievous Scheduler</em>: take seemingly-innocent parallel code and run it so that it breaks.</p>
<p>You can step each thread line-by-line (and undo your steps), and some non-atomic instructions can be expanded into atomic parts (i.e., <code>i = i + 1</code> translates to a separate load and store). Sometimes, you have to do this to properly crack the challenges, like in <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/#T2-Expansion">Tutorial 2: Non-Atomic Instructions</a>.</p>
<p>If you feel bored by how simple the first challenges are, scroll down a bit. The <em>Deadlock Empire</em> quest at the bottom should keep you busy for a while :)</p>
<p>I think it took us around 18 hours of actual work to write <em>The Deadlock Empire</em>: both of us had a bit of shut-eye early morning and we didn’t have enough time by the end to start working on the really ambitious features, so the last few hours were just a commit here and there, fixing up a font or an obscure bug.</p>
<p>There aren’t many shiny technologies: it’s plain HTML5 and JavaScript with jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other things. The game has a simple “internal virtual machine” that executes simple instructions, like “increment this global variable”, “lock this lock and block this thread”, and so on. We used pseudo-C# as the challenge language mostly because of our familiarity with its ideas about concurrency, but it would be straightforward to write in pseudo-Java instead.</p>
<p>In the upcoming days, we’ll add more synchronization primitives and polish the experience. We want this game to be more fun, educational and useful.</p>
<p>I now have a favorite bookstore. Next door from their regular store, Cambridge University Press sells their damaged books. (Even through the only damage I found on them was the red ‘DAMAGED’ stamp at the front page.) Awesome books on advanced mathematics and CS, philosophy, sociology, biology. For 3 pounds a paperback or 7 pounds a hardcover. People grab them by the stack. Note to self: bring big suitcase next time.</p>
<p>Also:</p>

<p>WE WON THE HACKATHON!!! HOOORAY!!!!1111</p>

<p>We also won the <em>Best Hack in Gaming/VR</em> award (judged by Improbable) and <em>Bloomberg’s Favorite Hack</em>.</p>
