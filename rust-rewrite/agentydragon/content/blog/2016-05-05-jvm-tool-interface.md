title: JVM Tool Interface
---

At school, I gave a short, roughly 15-minute talk on JVM Tool Interface. It's
a part of the JVM that people use to build debuggers, profilers, and similar
tools that affect or observe the running JVM. I focused mostly on the
interesting technical parts: the architecture, how do they make the JVM run
fast while being instrumented, how they deal with native code, and such.
