title: Trying "Things to learn" and "Documented systems"
---

It's been a long silence for me on this homepage. Stuff has been happening,
but somehow I didn't find the time to write much.

I'm trying out a new thing. I have a lot of stuff I want to learn some day,
but I don't have the time to learn all of it (and often I also don't have the
leftover energy to do personal-development type stuff, but that is another
problem). I've had a bunch of systems to remember the interesting things I
want to learn - a file on my disk, then a more complex file on my disk,
then my laptop crashed, then Google Keep.

So the new thing I'm trying is that I'm adding a new page here called
[Things to learn](/wiki/learn.html). When I find a new thing I want to deeply
understand some day, I write it into the list. And when I (some day) feel like
diving into a thing, I will pick one up from the list, spend a bunch of time
learning it, and then I'll write a thing, put it on my website and link it
from there.

Why this might be good:

* I won't hopefully end up forgetting and then relearning the same stuff.
* Writing something down makes it easier to spot confusion or weak spots in
  understanding. (Maybe it's because I spend a lot of time reviewing code.
  Seeing something written in monospace font makes me go like "huh I'm not
  sure please write a test".)
* I will produce stuff :)

Let's see how it goes.

Documented systems
===

Oh by the way, there is a more general thing I've been trying which I think
might be useful for me.

So [CFAR](http://rationality.org) teaches this thing they call "systematization".
(CFAR - Putting Names on Things &trade;)
Examples are:

* Having your underwear in the top shelf, then the socks, then shorts, etc.,
  and keeping it that way.
* A checklist you follow when you need to pack up for a flight.
* Putting all your appointments and other fixed commitments into Google
  Calendar.

Systems are useful, because they standardize things. Preparing a flight
checklist once and then following it 10 times is easier than figuring out
if there's anything important you're forgetting 10 times at different
occassions.

I have a few systems. They have come to be mostly "on their own", and I might
not remember the reason they turned out the way they are.

I want to try making my systems explicit - by writing down a documentation for
what each system looks like, what problems does it solve, and such. I want that
because:

* It makes sure the system actually is there for something.
  This prevents a failure mode I've been in after my CFAR workshop, which I
  once called "cargo cult rationality". It's running around beating at random
  things with CFAR techniques, trying to be a great and conscientious
  rationalist. (I guess "cargo cult rationality" is also a thing worth writing
  about some day...)
* It stores the system out of my mind. For example, I have a system for which
  things to have in my backpack and where. It tends to deteriorate, and when
  the chaos threatens to overwhelm my backpack, I can just refer to the
  explicit description of what goes where, and maybe update it if needed.
  I don't have to solve the problem of "figure out the optimal things to put
  into my backpack and where to put them" every time it gets too messy.
* It enables debugging.

The way I think of it right now is to have a "source code for my systems", sort
of. Right now I have a like 5-page Google doc with a mix of where things go
in my apartment, how to pack for things, and where things go in my backpack,
and the motivation and open problems for each.
