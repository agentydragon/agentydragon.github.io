title: Trip to Chernobyl
---

I went to visit Ukraine and the Chernobyl exclusion zone in particular
with some old and some new friends.
It was awesome and I can wholeheartedly recommend the folks from
[Expedition Club](http://www.expeditionclub.cz/), who kindly arranged the trip
for us. I've wanted to do this way back since I first played S.T.A.L.K.E.R.,
probably about 9 or so years ago.

I have a bunch of photos [on my Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10209143389375467.1073741831.1641657189&type=1&l=b3efef60bf).

Aside from Chernobyl, we also spent 2 days in Kiev. I didn't enjoy the
atmosphere and architecture too much - it's full of socialist high-rises.
Not saying Prague isn't, but Kiev looks like 90% of it was built in the 80's.
The Statue of Mother Ukraine, which is slightly larger than the Statue of Liberty,
has a pretty good museum of WWII inside. They also show off army vehicles
(mostly tanks, and at least one helicopter) nearby. The statue and its
surroundings are a pinnacle of socialist realism.

Then, we spent 2 days in the exclusion zone, and after that, we went to Neptun,
which is a boat-turned-fishing base/hostel/restaurant in the delta of the Dnepr.
The way there was really adventurous: let me tell you, you don't know bad roads
until you see the villages of Ukraine.
When we finally arrived to the riverbank, a speedboat from Neptun took us and
our things for the night and we sped towards Neptun. The ride there around all
the tiny islands of the Dnepr delta under the moonlight was amazing.
The next day, we said goodbye to Neptun and all its fuzzy kitties, doggies and
puppies and headed back to Kiev.

On the way back to Kiev, our gearbox decided to kick the bucket - shifting gears
was an ordeal for Ondra. Accidentally, we made a wrong turn at one point and
headed toward a military facility and got stopped at a checkpoint. All right,
let's turn around and head back. Only the gearbox decided to not let us shift
into reverse. So, we stood in front of the gate for like 20 minutes, Ondra
frantically trying to shift to reverse and the guard getting more and more
amused. Slowly, more and more soldiers from the checkpoint looked at the
spectacle, until one hero went and helped us shift the gears, letting us leave
a full squad of ~15 laughing servicemen. Fun times!

On our second day in Kiev (after Chernobyl and Neptun), we ziplined from one
end of Dnepr to the other one, which was fun, if somewhat shorter than expected.
We also saw some old churches, the Majdan and so forth.

More experiences: Ukraine is crazy cheap, which I'm saying having spent
most of my life in Czech Republic, already a pretty cheap country.
Once you figure out the alphabet, the language is very easy to read.
Speaking in Czecho-Slovako-Polish is also a good supplement for English.

Radiation exposure
===

We couldn't agree about how large the dose you get in Chernobyl actually is,
so I decided to do a little bit of research. The second day of our visit in the
Zone, I wrote down the value of the dosimeter roughly every 10 minutes plus
every now and then.

The background radiation level in normal cities is (ballparking it) about 0.12 &mu;Sv/h.
My idea was I would just look at the dosimeter every 10 minutes and then
approximate the dose we received by representing each 10 minute interval
by the value I measured by its end.

After seeing what the dozimeter did during the short ride through the Red
Forest, I think that might be the wrong approach to go about it -- the dose
you receive in Chernobyl might not be dominated by the elevated level of
background radiation (which is only 2&times;-4&times; higher than in
uncontaminated areas, from my data) - the more important factor might be very
short intervals spent in radiation hot pockets, which would be hard to pick up
by 10-minute measurements. Look at the Red Forest ride: during it, the radiation
levels were 20-30&times; the normal levels.

Next time, I'll just bring my own dosimeter. With logging, and blackjack and
hookers.
