## Next step: half-cheetah, TD3, continuous actions

I'm not doing all that great emotionally, but I'm trying to keep learning RL,
even if slowly. I made Cartpole and Lunar Landing environments work. Both of
them have discrete actions. The next environment I went to try to learn was the
[Half Cheetah](https://www.endtoend.ai/envs/gym/mujoco/half-cheetah/).

<figure>

</figure>

In this environment, you control a simple robot and are trying to teach it to
run. You control it with continuous signals. I'm not sure what exactly they
mean, probably something like force applied to joints. Continuous actions mean
you need to use slightly different algorithms. I went to learn TD3 (twin delayed
deep deterministic actor-critic), based on [OpenAI's treatment in Spinning Up in
Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/td3.html). It was
published in a 2018 paper called [Addressing Function Approximation Error in
Actor-Critic Methods][paper].

### Sidenote: depending on MuJoCo sucks

The vanilla half-cheetah environment is written with MuJoCo. MuJoCo is a
*commercial* physics simulator used for a lot of robotics environments like
this. You need a license to run it. As of now (October 18, 2021), there is a
free license available for everyone to run MuJoCo until the end of this month.
But in general, closed-source dependencies for open research *suck*.

There's this open-source physics engine called [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/).
I've played with it a bit in middle-high school when I was trying to write some
3D stuff. Turns out they have since made Python bindings, and implemented a
bunch of OpenAI Gym environments. So you can now run lots of environments
without MuJoCo :)

To use the PyBullet environments, install the `pybullet` Python package and
`import pybullet_envs`. The PyBullet repo has [the list of implemented
environments](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_envs/__init__.py).

### Sidenote 2: Actually MuJoCo is now open-source

So, later on the same day I wrote this post, turns out DeepMind bought MuJoCo
and made it open-source and free (at https://mujoco.org/). Good stuff :)

## TD3 description

### Q learning

To describe TD3 briefly, it's similar to Q learning.

In Q learning, you're learning a function \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta(s,a)\\), and a
policy \\(\\pi\\). You update \\(\\theta\\) to make \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta(s,a)\\)
match closer to the actual Q function for the policy \\(\\pi\\), and you also
update the policy \\(\\pi\\) to gradually improve. You can do this exactly if
you have a small enough environment to hold all this in memory. The procedure
you use to make \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta\\) approximate
\\(\\mathrm{Q}\_\\pi\\) is basically SARSA: you minimize the squared error
between \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta(s,a)\\) and an estimator that converges to
center on the actual \\(\\mathrm{Q}\_\\pi(s,a)\\). In the finite case, that
Q learning estimator for a transition \\(s \\xrightarrow{a} (r, s')\\) is
\\(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} \\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta(s',a')\\). In vanilla Q
learning, the followed policy is \\(\\mathrm{greedy}(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}})\\),
which is what that maximum does.

But when you're in a continuous action space, you can't just \\(\\arg\\max\\)
over all possible actions.

### DDPG

Enter DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), in which you maintain 2
networks: the *critic* \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta(s,a)\\) which approximates
the Q value of the current policy, and the *actor* - a deterministic policy
\\(\\pi\_\\varphi: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}\\), which you improve
based on the critic's estimations.

Run the agent with your current policy in a replay buffer, plus with some
exploration (like a bit of Gaussian noise added to actions). Draw a batch from
the replay buffer, and do an optimization step on the critic to minimize its
Bellman error:
$$\arg\min_\theta \sum_{(s,a,r,s') \in \mathrm{batch}}
\left[\hat{\mathrm{Q}}_\theta(s,a) - (r + \gamma \hat{\mathrm{Q}}_\theta(s', \pi_\varphi(s')))\right]^2 $$
Then update the actor to choose actions that get better Q values on the same
batch:
$$\arg\max_\varphi \sum_{(s,a) \in \mathrm{batch}} \hat{\mathrm{Q}}_\theta(s,\pi_\varphi(s))$$
The batch has to be drawn randomly. This is important, because if you draw a
bunch of states that immediately follow each other, their predictions will end
up pulling each other to explode towards infinity.

To prevent similar feedback cycles between the actor and critic, you keep 2
copies of each: the *optimized* one and the *target* one. They start out as
exact copies. When computing the Bellman targets for the critic, instead of
using the *optimized* actor and critic, use the *target* ones:
$$\arg\min_\theta \sum_{(s,a,r,s') \in \mathrm{batch}}
\left[\hat{\mathrm{Q}}_{\theta_\text{opt}}(s,a) - (r + \gamma \hat{\mathrm{Q}}_{\theta_\text{targ}}(s', \pi_{\varphi_\text{targ}}(s')))\right]^2 $$
And slowly [Polyak-average](https://paperswithcode.com/method/polyak-averaging)
the target networks towards the optimized one (with \(\varrho \\approx 0.05\)):
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta_\text{targ} & \gets \varrho \cdot \theta_\text{opt} + (1-\varrho) \cdot \theta_\text{targ} \\
\varphi_\text{targ} & \gets \varrho \cdot \varphi_\text{opt} + (1-\varrho) \cdot \varphi_\text{targ}
\end{align*}
$$
By the way, I made up this a shorthand notation for this operation "update x towards
y with update size \(\\alpha\)":
$$\require{extpfeil}
\theta_\text{targ} \xmapsto{\varrho} \theta_\text{opt}, \varphi_\text{targ}
\xmapsto{\varrho} \varphi_\text{opt}
$$

### TD3

Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient was introduced in a paper called
[Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods][paper].
Note the "function approximation error" part. This talks about the error
inherent in how \\(\\hat{\\mathrm{Q}}\_\\theta\\) approximates the real
\\(\\mathrm{Q}\_\\pi\\). In particular, if in a state \\(s\\), the critic
overestimates the Q value for some action \\(a\\), the actor's optimization
step will be incentivized to exploit that overestimation. But that doesn't mean
it'll actually get a better result.

TD3 adds 3 steps to address this:

1. *Target policy smoothing*: in the Bellman update, instead of expecting to
   follow \\(\\pi\_{\\varphi\_\\text{targ}}\\) exactly, add a bit of Gaussian
   noise to the chosen action. That way the policy can't try to hit a small peak
   of overestimation by the critic.
2. *Twin critics*: train 2 critics, both to minimize the Bellman error. Optimize
   the policy to maximize one of them. Instead of setting critics' targets based
   on one critic, choose the target based on the lesser of their two
   predictions. If you train 2 networks, they're unlikely to overestimate the
   real Q function in the same place.
   $$\arg\min_\theta \sum_{i \in {1, 2}} \sum_{(s,a,r,s') \in \mathrm{batch}}
   \left[\hat{\mathrm{Q}}_{\theta_{i, \text{opt}}}(s,a) - (r + \gamma \min_{j\in {1, 2}}\hat{\mathrm{Q}}_{\theta_{j, \text{targ}}}(s', \pi_{\varphi_\text{targ}}(s')))\right]^2 $$
3. *Delayed policy updates*: update the policy just once per 2 batches (i.e.,
   2x slower than the critics).

## Rai's ML mistake #5: Multiplication? What multiplication?

The following happened over the course of ~6 weeks, as I gathered a few hours at
a time of energy, will, etc. to work on this.

So, I go and implement my algorithm and run it. On my first try, I implement it
wrong because I misremember how to implement it. I go back to Spinning Up in
Deep RL, smack myself on the forehead, and go fix it. Run it again.

It's learning *something*. The average reward is going up. But slowly.

<figure>
![Slowly increasing mean reward graph](/static/2021-10-18-mean-reward.png)
</figure>

Then, over the next ~4 weeks, whenever I have some time, I try to bang my head
against the keyboard some more. Tweak all the hyperparameters. Look up the
hyperparameters they use in [rl-baselines3-zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo/blob/master/hyperparams/td3.yml).
No dice. Repeat for a while, for all hyperparameters - critic learning rate,
actor learning rate, actor delay, replay buffer size, batch size, Polyak rate,
discount rate, initial random action steps. Rewrite the code twice-thrice. Still
the same issue. Keep it training for several days. Does not help. Repeat a few
times.

### Thanks God there's a reference implementation

I wanted to implement this algorithm on my own, because I want to grok it.
But I got to the end of my wits here, and started thinking: "hell, can this
algorithm even *solve this environment*"? [The paper][paper] had graphs and
results with the half-cheetah. But that was the MuJoCo half-cheetah. Maybe the
PyBullet half-cheetah had a different reward scale and this was actually as good
as it went?

Unlikely. All my half-cheetah did in evaluation was stand upright without moving.
Maybe sometimes kinda jump once.

<figure>
![Standing half-cheetah](/static/2021-10-18-standing.png)
</figure>

But yeah. Let's run the reference implementation and see what it does. I start
it for a few minutes, and...

```
...
Total T: 109000 Episode Num: 109 Episode T: 1000 Reward: 938.893
Total T: 110000 Episode Num: 110 Episode T: 1000 Reward: 987.304
---------------------------------------
Evaluation over 10 episodes: 963.088
---------------------------------------
```

God dammit. I was getting *maybe*, on a *lucky episode*, like 300 at most, and
that was *after millions of training steps*...

### Does it just not work because of Tensorflow?!

Okay, so I have code A which does not work (my code), and code B which does
(reference implementation). I know what to do here. Align code A and code B
together so that they're similar, and then scour the diff line by line.
Somewhere in there there's my bug.

I refactor my code, rename variables, etc., until the diff is small.

Now the only diff I see is basically me using Tensorflow and the reference
implementation using PyTorch. Stuff like this:

```
2,3c3,7
< import tensorflow as tf
< from tensorflow.keras import layers as tfkl
---
> import torch
> import torch.nn as nn
> import torch.nn.functional as F
136,137c123,124
<         state = tf.expand_dims(state, axis=0)
<         return tf.squeeze(self.actor(state), axis=0).numpy()
---
>         state = torch.FloatTensor(state.reshape(1, -1)).to(device)
>         return self.actor(state).cpu().data.numpy().flatten()
```

And yet, my code doesn't work, and their code does.

I bang my head against this for maybe 2 more days. So, where can the differences
be?

Maybe different action scaling. I align action scaling like they do. Instead of
"sigmoid, then rescale from 0 to 1 into `action_space.low` to
`action_space.high`", I do their "tanh, then multiply by
`action_space.high`". Those should be basically the same thing, but I do it
anyway just to be safe. Still doesn't work.

Maybe different initialization. Unlikely, but possible.
Their code uses Torch's [Linear](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html).
It initializes weights and biases both randomly from
\\(\\text{Uniform}([\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\text{input size}} }])\\).
I use TensorFlow/Keras's [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense).
It uses [Xavier uniform initialization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers/GlorotUniform)
(aka Glorot initialization, named ... after someone named Xavier Glorot)
by default, which draws from
\\(\\text{Uniform}([\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{\\text{input size} + \\text{output size} } }])\\).
And TensorFlow initializes biases to zero.
Okay. I rewrite the TensorFlow initialization to do the same thing as Torch.
Still the same. God dammit.

Does the ADAM optimizer in TensorFlow and PyTorch work differently? ... Maybe.
I'm gonna shelve the idea of stepping through it for later.

### Copy the whole goddamn setup

I decide that I'll copy even more of their code. Okay, this is unlikely, but
what if there's something wrong with how I initialize the environment or
something? I copy their `main.py`, switch it to TensorFlow, and use their
`utils.py`.

And now it works, and I scream.

It's the `utils.py` that did it. [That file in their repo](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3/blob/master/utils.py)
implements the replay buffer. I didn't pore over my implementation in detail,
because ... hey, it's the simplest part. How would I mess up a replay buffer?

Their replay buffer exists in RAM, and has NumPy arrays. It uses NumPy's
randomness. I use TensorFlow variables and TensorFlow's [`tf.random.Generator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random/Generator).

After some work, I find the culprit lines.

Here's how my code stores the replay buffer's rewards and "is this the final
state" flag:

```python
class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, max_size=int(1e6)):
	# ... snip ...
        self.reward = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((max_size, )), dtype=tf.float32)
        self.not_done = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((max_size, ), dtype=tf.float32),
                                    dtype=tf.float32)
```

And this is how they do it:

```python
class ReplayBuffer(object):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, max_size=int(1e6)):
	# ... snip ...
        self.reward = np.zeros((max_size, 1))
        self.not_done = np.zeros((max_size, 1))
```

What's the difference? I have a vector, a 1-dimensional tensor. They have a
2-dimensional tensor, with second dimension 1.

### And of course it's goddamn tensor shapes.

And of course it's goddamn tensor shapes.

On its own, it doesn't matter whether I have the replay buffer shaped like I had
it, or like they did.

What matters is what happens when I combine it with this code which computes
the target Q values:

```python
# Select action according to policy and add clipped noise
noise = tf.random.normal(shape=action.shape) * self.policy_noise
noise = tf.clip_by_value(noise, -self.noise_clip, self.noise_clip)

next_action = (self.actor_target(next_state) + noise)
next_action = tf.clip_by_value(next_action, -self.max_action,
			       self.max_action)

# Compute the target Q value
target_Q1, target_Q2 = self.critic_target((next_state, next_action))
target_Q = tf.math.minimum(target_Q1, target_Q2)
target_Q = reward + not_done * self.discount * target_Q
```

TD3 maintains 2 critics. `critic_target` is a Keras model, which contains two
stacks of feed-forward layers. At the end, they have a
`q_value = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, ...)`, and then the whole model returns the
tuple `(q1_value, q2_value)`.

With that in mind, what's the shape of `target_Q1`?

No, it's not $(\text{batch size})$. It's $(\text{batch size}, 1)$. Because
of course there's the last dimension of size 1 - if your model has more than 1
output node, you need to stack them.

What's the shape of `not_done`?

With my replay buffer, it was $(\text{batch size})$. One scalar per experience
in batch, right? With the reference implementation's replay buffer, it was
$(\text{batch size}, 1)$.

Consider the line `target_Q = reward + not_done * self.discount * target_Q`,
where `target_Q` has shape $(\text{batch size}, 1)$ and, as established for my
code, `not_done` has shape $(\text{batch size})$. What's the shape of the
computed expression?

If you answered $(\text{batch size}, \text{batch size})$, I guess you win.
And that was not intended. I wanted it to be $(\text{batch size})$ - one
target Q value for one replay experience in batch.

What happens next with this `target_Q`?

```python
@tf.function
def _mse(x, y):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.squared_difference(x, y))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # Get current Q estimates
    current_Q1, current_Q2 = self.critic((state, action))

    # Compute critic loss
    critic_loss = (_mse(current_Q1, target_Q) +
		   _mse(current_Q2, target_Q))

# Optimize the critic
self.critic_optimizer.minimize(
    critic_loss, tape=tape, var_list=self.critic.trainable_variables)
```

... Great. `current_Q1` / `current_Q2` have shapes $(\text{batch size}, 1)$,
which is compatible with $(\text{batch size}, \text{batch size})$. So they get
auto-broadcast... and `reduce_mean` gladly reduces the matrix of squared errors
to a scalar mean. Awesome. Thank you. I'm so glad Autobroadcast Man and Default
Options Girl arrived and saved the day.

### Learnings

So what did I learn today?

It's always, *always*, **ALWAYS** those goddamn tensor shapes.

Put [`tf.debugging.assert_shapes`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_shapes)
f\*\*\*ing **everywhere**.

And probably write unit tests, too. I probably won't be bothered to do that
anyway because writing unit tests for code that has complex optimizers and
neural nets is annoying.

And maybe I should be using operators that don't auto-broadcast, or something
that doesn't allow me to mistakenly vector-vector-to-matrix multiply when I
mean to vector-vector-elementwise multiply.

I'm not done being annoyed and sour about this but I'm done ranting about it
here. Ciao, see you next time I kill a few weeks on another mistake this stupid.
This is the point of all those "Rai's ML mistakes" posts. I write these
algorithms so I can grok them, and I headsmash the keyboard this way because
I hope now I'll remember with a bit more clarity and immediacy: "It's always the
goddamn tensor shapes".

My fixed code is [on my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/agentydragon/rl-experiments/-/merge_requests/8), and here's the obligatory scoot-scoot:
