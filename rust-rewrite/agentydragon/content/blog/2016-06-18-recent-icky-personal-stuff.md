title: Recent icky personal stuff
---

So far, 2016 has been a pretty interesting year of me. I discovered a lot about
myself and I had both the happiest and saddest time in years. I hope you like
icky personal stuff, because this post will be unusually full of it.

The first time in my life, I had a crush on someone and I told them about it.
My previous method of dealing with love was mostly hoping that maybe senpai
will notice me. That, of course, didn't ever work.
I don't claim rationality.

I was lucky and a relationship followed for a few months.
I felt *very* much in love.
But there were problems that weren't properly dealt with and I didn't pay
nearly enough attention to.
And so, suddenly, poof, no relationship no more.

I had depression for the following ~4 weeks.
(I concluded this was actual depression from my results on the Beck Depression
Inventory.)
At first, I mourned losing someone I loved.
After I first successfully applied CBT on myself (with the help of talking it
over with others), I wrote [Updating][updating].
You can read that with *X* set to something like *He loves me*.

I noticed that the bad thoughts I have been thinking were familiar - I
have thought some variations of them many times in the past. A hard one to
verbalize feels like a searing mental pain from being unloved, or from being
rejected. Some were variations on *Nobody likes me and I have no real friends*.
These bring back painful memories of the times people have been mean to me,
mostly in my childhood.

Then, I looked very hard for answers, probably thinking maybe there was some
way I could fix whatever broke the relationship, or at least have it not
happen again.

I realized that this was probably a textbook [dependent relationship][dependent]
on my part. I sincerely felt that this totally best person was the center
of my world. I derived my feeling of satisfaction with my life from
the relationship.

I came to the conclusion that a spiral of my dysfunctions played
a large role in the breakdown of the relationship. It starts with one
tiny problem that makes me feel a little bit insecure, because it looks like
a threat to a relationship that's the center of my world. One way I deal with
insecurities is emotionally detaching, which creates communication problems.
Communication problems lead to more problems, which make me feel more insecure.
And more detached. And when I'm detached, I can completely miss emotional
clues. Or the fact that things are not going well and that the current
trajectory leads downwards. Which might be why the breakup surprised me so.

I turned my attention inward.

Two young fish are swimming in a fish tank. An older fish comes by and asks:
"Morning, boys, how's the water?" The two young fish swim on for a bit, and then
one looks at the other and goes, "What the hell is water?"

On proper reflection, I have a lot of issues. When your issues have been
with you long enough, you don't see them floating in the corner of your vision.
The way I saw them was looking backward. Once I knew what to look for in my
personal history, I saw them at work undoing my happiness all over the
place. Noticing the way you think is harder than it sounds. I'm working on
spotting my issues at work more readily so I can course-correct faster.

Why am I writing this?
The true reason is just because I want to, it feels good to talk about myself.
I also have a few rationalizations.

A: I did well for myself in school and in work and some people look up to me,
admiring my abilities in CS and math. And yet, I, the guy who can program his
way out of anywhere and who never got a C on an exam at uni, have problems.
This sends a message: nobody's perfect, everyone has problems and it's OK
to talk about them.

B: Maybe you'll recognize someone you know or maybe even yourself. Maybe me
talking about things I'm working on will help you see opportunities for your
own personal development.

Yay, issues!

Social anxiety
---
One symptom I call (for now) *social anxiety*.
It doesn't usually manifest as actually feeling anxious when dealing with
strangers. I just avoid doing anything that means dealing with strangers.
Say, even something as stupid as buying new pants. I never actually think
*OK, I need to avoid buying new pants because I don't want to deal
with people*. I just never go buy new pants. Ask me why? I'll probably whip up
a rationalization.

Detachment
---
Another one is the *detachment* I mentioned earlier.
I think I developed that in middle school. I had a crush on a girl and I
couldn't for the love of god bring myself to do anything about it. Then, by a
coincidence of my stupidity and my classmates' nosiness, my entire class found
out I liked boy parts. I haven't been very well-educated about sexuality by
then, so my thought process was mostly *OK, now everyone thinks/knows I'm gay.
That's a bad thing. People think badly about me because of that. Nobody can
find out, especially not my parents. If people found out, I could never
be happy again.* Also, *now since everyone thinks I'm gay, any chance I ever
had of being with the girl I love is ruined beyond repair*.
(Of course, probably not a single one of these statements was actually true.)
So, I felt I couldn't be helped by anyone, so I didn't talk to anyone.
And, maybe to prevent my parents from finding out how sad and vulnerable I
felt (because that would only harm me further), I started acting like a tough,
emotionless, hostile robot. If you see me spitting venom with an empty
expression on my face, it probably means I feel threatened on some level.
(It just so happens [Spitting Venom by Modest Mouse][spitting-venom] is one of
my favorite songs. Synchronicity.)

I think the most common reason I go detached is that I feel I'm being left out
or ignored for some reason.

Aside: In the end, I think the aforementioned thought process is what
eventually led me to believe I was gay, which I still believed in 2015. But,
on proper reflection, while I seem to prefer man parts, the fact of the matter
is that there are men I like and there are women I like. Would I say I'm
bisexual? Maybe it's the right word to describe my experience. But I no longer
think a label on my sexuality is an important part of my identity.
(Yet I still exclaim that in a public post. I like showing off. Shoot me.)

Workaholism
---
I think I placed too much value on my work even before high school. Even on
my first small side-gigs I did for random people, I put in very long hours for
peanuts and I tried to make everything perfect. I also always liked learning
scientific stuff. In high school, I took a lot of electives and worked more
side jobs.

By the end of high school, I think I got the idea of becoming a Successful
Software Engineer, which I worked towards up until now.

In my university, you basically get a free reign over your schedule. I got to
work and optimized my first-year and second-year schedules. To the extent that
my schedule looked like a huge rectangle all over every day of the entire
workweek. (I even wrote a [schedule optimizer][sched-optimizer]
to optimize my schedule for me. Hello, Twilight Sparkle.)

A 3-year bachelor's costs you 180 credits. After 2 years, I had 211.

On top of that, I kept on taking side jobs, and in my second year, I started my
internship at Prizeo. My schedule slipped and I ended up going to work as one of
the first people and leaving very late. I worked on useful features, yes. But I
actually spent huge chunks of my time doing useless busywork I created for
myself in retrospect. Like fixing bugs nobody cared about, refactoring the
packing optimizer the 8th time, changing spaces for tabs. Embarassingly enough,
I also looked a lot at GitHub's contribution charts. I was almost always first
in number of commits and pull requests. I know, right? If I remember correctly,
I probably had a vague expectation of recognition. Did I realize there was
anything pathological about what I was doing? Nope.

I also started tracking my net worth in a graph, which I looked at several
times per day. It's nice to see your score go up, isn't it?

At Google in Paris, it got even more out of control. I almost never got around
to doing anything I liked outside of work, so I spent my time at work morning
to night. I got a slight twinge of satisfaction when I got a peer bonus for
working so well.

In general, I think most of the work I did I didn't do for money to do things
with. That was just a side-effect. It was probably just so I could have less
free time alone to fill with feelings of sadness and loneliness.

Overeating
---
That might have been my first unhealthy (unhealth*iest*, too) coping mechanism.
I've had problems with overeating since the first years of primary school.
Food, especially sugar, is satisfying and numbing, and it feels better to eat
than to think about how everyone hates you for being fat (and a smart-ass).

And so on
---

*Very low impulsivity*: I often am just about to do something or say
something, but stop myself before I do. Probably something about fear of
criticism or rejection.
I also think I often act not the way I want to or the way I am, but the way I
think other people expect me to act. There's an interesting concept called
[true self and false self][true-false-self] on Wiki.

*Scarcely having fun on purpose*: Before 2016, I almost never did anything
fun myself because I wanted to. Lunch in a nice restaurant? A walk in a park on
a sunny day? This easy fun thing I had on my bucket list for ages?
Nope, let's just browse Reddit all day.
I seem to act as if I were incapable of having any fun on my own, so I end up
having no fun on my own, which undermines my self-esteem.

*"I am unacceptable"*: I act as if I can't open myself up to other people,
because then they would hate me or reject me. Before I came out as gay, I
thought something like "if people knew I'm gay, they'd hate me, so I must be
careful so that nobody can tell". After that, there's always a ton of
irrelevant bullshit my brain can substitute. "Hey, remember stupid
embarassing thing #71? I bet everyone would shun you if they knew."
The consequence is problems opening up to other people, which sucks.
I even do that with close friends, family, and romantic interests or partners.

*"Other people don't like me"*: thinking that is an easy way to get people not
to like you. Sample intermediate steps: "Huh, this random sentence she just
said could be possibly interpreted as criticism/teasing/... . She doesn't like
me, so it indeed is, and that's a purposeful attack on me." A: "Let's fight
back.", B: "Let's be passive-agressive to her now.", ...
*"I have no real friends"* is another thought that can ruin my enjoyment of any
activity, especially one I'm enjoying with my friends.

*Bad self-image*: I think my idea of my looks and fitness developed in high
school at the height of obesity, and I didn't yet properly update after fixing
that.

*Abuse of recreational drugs*: I have used marihuana, and I think at least some
of it was for the numbing effect.

*"I need a relationship to be happy"*: This one undermines happiness and
self-worth when you think it while single.

I read that *"I have wasted my life"* is also frequent and destructive.
[The Near Future][the-near-future] is practically dripping with it.

I like helping people. In high school, I got a ton of satisfaction when I
wrote exercises on complex numbers for Khan Academy, which helped a lot of
people learn, and I dreamt of working there one day. I might have a tendency
to attach myself to people I can help. I have strong feelings about effective
altruism. *"Helper's syndrome"* might be part of my mix.

Finally, I easily get jealous when I perceive someone as being more successful
than me, when it comes to relationships, friendships and doing fun things.

What now
---
Save a day or two here and there, I have been mostly OK for the last few weeks.
I'm seeing a psychologist in a few days to get some professional advice and
possibly treatment.
(Since I have been reading [Feeling Good][feeling-good] just before
I became full-blown depressed and reading more psych stuff afterwards, there's
some possibility I'm just imagining most of it and being a hypochondriac with
[confirmation bias][confirmation-bias]. We shall see.)
There's some serious self-improvement I'm working on.

I'm purposefully organizing my free time to maximize fun.
I'm using a [Pleasure-predicting Sheet][ppsheet], which is a technique from
[Feeling Good by David Burns][feeling-good]. (It's intended to build confidence
that you don't need other people to have fun, but I also use it to force myself
to have fun on purpose.)
I push against my social anxiety by doing more people things and seeing that
people bite way less than my stupid lizard brain thinks.
I took on running and jiu-jitsu - sports are supposed to help with depression.
My self-esteem is particularly low when it comes to my looks and my fitness
and running a 5k in 26:30 helps with that. I use [Zombies, Run][zombies].
Talking also helps.

My original plan for this year was finishing a thesis before October,
grabbing my master's, and then working for Google as a software engineer
(I got an offer).

Stupidly (and workaholically), I spent the winter semester working on Factorify
instead of on my thesis. In the summer semester, I had my failed enmeshed
romance, and then my depression. Now, I mostly don't work on it. I usually
procrastinate or start getting bad feelings after an hour or two. I make a very
small step every week or two. If I pushed myself, I might be able to finish it
this year, but it's not very likely. I'm also no longer so sure I want
the degree enough.

I'm ~99% certain I didn't get the H-1b visa for Google Mountain View, so it'll
probably come down to deciding whether would I want to work for them in Europe,
and if so, where and when. When I'm in a good mood, I think Zurich or London
would be nice.
But I worry that might be just a [cached dream][cached-thought] of the
career-obsessed past-me and that moving would just put me under more stress
than I can safely handle. On the other hand, making software used to make me
happy before. Would I be happier on a year-long vacation without any
programming?
One question I'll have to reconsider as well is: Do I actually want to
work in software?

I think "Yes".
I have at least one other idea. Do I want to work in AI safety?
The question of the importance of AGI has been lingering in my mind for months.
It's confusing to my intuition, which is, of course, not a LessWrong-rational
argument. And I don't (yet?) defer to LessWrong-rationality when confused.
I applied to MIRI's 2016 Summer Fellowship, mostly hoping it would convince
me either way, but I didn't make the cut. (My impression is that I didn't have
enough research and math credentials, which means there's probably someone
who has more of those than me working on AI safety now, which is good news.)
Before my depression, I was slowly reading up on MIRI material and I was hoping
of getting more information and meeting AGI researchers once I got to Bay Area.
Alas, no Bay Area for me, and since my depressed brain is vulnerable to the
issue, I'm putting it on hold.

For now, I'm leaving the question of my future open until it comes knocking.
I don't like to think about it too hard. Wherever I go (or not go) next, I want
to feel comfortable in my skin.

Thank you for reading. I thrive on your attention.
